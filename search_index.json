It is complementary to the first half of PH40112, which focusses on General Relativity and its applications to Cosmology. At the end of this course, you should be able to describe the key ideas of Cosmology, comparing and contrasting different observational techniques and Cosmological models. You should understand the implications for the fate of the Universe arising from these different models, and discuss the open questions being addressed by current state of the art experiments. You should also be able to assess how systematic errors and experimental uncertainties affect cosmological experiments, in particular how these affect our ability to discriminate between different models of the Universe’s evolution.

Problem sheets will be released once the relevant material has been covered, but formal problems classes will not take place until week 11. The schedule was last updated on 2nd April. Changes to the planned schedule will be posted here and on the moodle page. Current Research Topics section The discussion session originally planned for April 2nd is no longer feasible. Two journal papers on different cosmological experiments will be posted on Moodle at the end of week 9. I will provide brief summaries of papers, and a list of questions you should have in mind when reading the papers. This section will have strong ties with the Observational Techniques sections, so you should ensure you are familiar with the material in that section when working on this. Suggested textbook This section of the course closely follows several chapters of An Introduction to Modern Cosmology: 3rd edition by Liddle. You may find it helpful to refer to this book or others such as The Oxford companion to Cosmology by Liddle and Loveday, which is available in the University library. Lecture notes, slides, recordings Written notes for lectures 1 - 10 will be made available online in html and PDF format. The html notes are available at https://vickyscowcroft.github.io/PH40112_rmd/ and will be updated throughout the course. PDF versions of the notes will be posted to the course Moodle page. The html notes have been designed so that the maths content is compatible with screen readers. Lectures will follow the same general structure as the written notes, but will not be identical - i.e. they will not be `skeleton’ notes for you to fill in the blanks. They are designed to support your learning of the lecture material, so you may find it useful to make your own notes during the session. PDF versions of the slides for each session will be posted on Moodle before each session. If you need these in an alternative format please let me know. Where appropriate, recordings will be made available to accompany the slides and lecture notes. "],
["ch-intro-obs.html", "Lecture 1 Overview of Observational Cosmology 1.1 The Cosmological Principle 1.2 A brief history of the Universe 1.3 The first second 1.4 After the first second: 1.5 The Expanding Universe", " Lecture 1 Overview of Observational Cosmology This section introduces the observational foundation of Cosmology. It builds upon the material in PH30111: Introduction to Galaxies and Cosmology. Some material may be familiar to you, but the origins and derivations of the equations will be discussed in more depth, and will include the relativistic treatment introduced in the first half of this course. 1.1 The Cosmological Principle The Cosmological Principle is the belief that our position in the Universe is not special in any way. If the Cosmological Principle holds, then there is no special position in the Universe, meaning that it should be the same everywhere (i.e. it should be homogeneous), and it should have no preferred direction (i.e. it should be isotropic) Clearly the Universe is not isotropic and homogeneous on small scales – the distributions of things like stars, planets and galaxies give more or less dense regions locally. But on a large scale, the Universe does display homogeneity and isotropy; Galaxy clusters are spread over the Universe and not concentrated to one side, and the CMB has only very tiny fluctuations. 1.2 A brief history of the Universe The ‘Cosmic Calendar’ shown in Figure 1.1 condenses the evolution of the Universe to a time-scale of 1 calendar year. If the Big Bang occurred on January 1st, human life wouldn’t exist until 11:52pm on 31st December! The formation of the Solar System would have occurred in September, and our home in the Galaxy, the disk of the Milky Way, would have formed in May. As Figure 1.1 shows, our understanding of how the Universe and our place in it has evolved over time uses different sources of evidence depending on the time frame. Our knowledge of recent history comes from written records, while our knowledge of the formation of the Solar System and the evolution of Earth comes from geology. However, to understand how the Universe as a whole came to be, we must look further back in time. Figure 1.1: The Cosmic Calendar. Credit: By Efbrazil, CC BY-SA 3.0. Figure 1.2 illustrates our current understanding of the evolution of the Universe, starting with the Big Bang, through to the Universe as we see it today. This section gives a brief history of the evolution; topics will be covered in further detail later in the course. We will not move through these chronologically in this course; instead this is intended to give you an overview of how the different ideas we cover come together. Figure 1.2: Evolution of the Universe. Original image credit: NASA/WMAP Science Team 1.3 The first second The first second after the Big Bang was quite dramatic. Highlights of this time are given below. Bear in mind that all of the following happens in less time than it takes for your heart to beat twice. The Big Bang \\((t = 0)\\) The Universe began with the Big Bang, rapidly expanding from an initial singularity. Planck epoch \\((t = 10^{-43}~s)\\) The Planck epoch refers to the stage when the Universe’s density exceeded a critical density, such that the energy scale is greater than the Planck scale. At this scale, quantum effects are important even for gravitational physics. Separation of forces \\((10^{-43}~s &lt; t &lt; 10^{-36}~s)\\) After the Planck epoch, other fundamental forces start to separate out. First, the gravitational force and electronuclear force decouple, then the electronuclear force separates out into the strong and electroweak forces. Inflation \\((t &lt; 10^{-32}~s)\\) Early in its evolution, the Universe underwent a period of rapid inflation, expanding by a factor of \\(10^{78}\\) (or \\(10^{26}\\) in each of the three spatial dimensions). Under this rapid expansion, an area of space of the order of 1 nm\\(^{3}\\) would expand to approximately 30 pc\\(^{3}\\) (equivalent to around 100 lyr\\(^{3})\\). Such expansion must occur at greater than the speed of light (\\(c\\)). However, as it is the metric of space time that is expanding, the limitation of exceeding \\(c\\) is not applicable, and inflation can occur. Electroweak symmetry breaking \\((t = 10^{-12}~s)\\) After inflation, the electroweak force separates into the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces. Quark epoch \\((t = 10^{-12}~s)\\) At the same time as electroweak symmetry breaking, the energy density of the Universe has decreased such that matter can exist in the form of quarks. Baryogenesis \\((t = 10^{-11}~s)\\) Baryogenesis is the stage where matter can start to exist in the form of baryons - e.g. protons, neutrons. Baryogenesis should have produced both baryons and anti-baryons (e.g. protons and anti-protons). Current evidence - i.e. the fact that we exist and are composed of baryons - shows that there must have been an asymmetry in the proportions of baryons/anti-baryons, otherwise they would have all have annihilated. The Baryogenesis process and baryon asymmetry are current areas of research. Hadron epoch \\((10^{-6}~s &lt; t &lt; 1~s)\\) The Hadron epoch occurred when the Universe had cooled far enough for hadrons to exist and dominate the energy density. The proportions of hadrons and anti-hadrons were similar, such that they were in thermal equilibrium and mostly annihilated, producing photons, although a small number of hadrons remained. Neutrino decoupling \\((t &lt; 1~s)\\) Around 1s after the Big Bang, neutrinos decoupled and were free to propagate through the Universe. Neutrinos have a very small interaction cross section, so the Cosmic Neutrino Background created at neutrino decoupling should still exist today. However, as the neutrinos produced at decoupling have such low energies, it is impossible to detect them with current experiments. Lepton epoch \\((1~s &lt; t &lt; 10~s)\\) Similar to the Hadron epoch, the Lepton epoch produced both leptons and anti-leptons (e.g, electrons, muons, neutrinos etc.) These would have annihilated, producing pairs of photons. A small number of leptons remain after annihilation. 1.4 After the first second: The Universe has now been evolving for around 1 s. It has exponentially expanded, created all the matter and radiation we see (and destroyed a whole load too), and gone through several rounds of fundamental physical forces. What else is left to do for the next 13.77 billion years? Photon epoch \\((10~s &lt; t &lt; 377,000\\text{ years})\\) After baryons, hadrons and leptons have mostly been annihilated, the majority of the Universe’s energy is dominated by photons. Light Element Nucleosynthesis \\((2 \\text{ mins} &lt; t &lt; 20\\text{ mins})\\) Nucleosynthesis is the stage where light elements (i.e., Hydrogen, Deuterium, Helium, Lithium) were formed. Elements heavier than Helium were very difficult to form due to the large amounts of energy/time required. Matter domination \\((t = 47,000\\text{ years})\\) Around 47,000 years after the Big Bang, the energy density of matter in the Universe overtakes that of radiation. Matter now becomes the dominant driver of the Universe’s evolution. Epoch of recombination and photon decoupling \\((t = 377,000\\text{ years})\\) During the epoch of recombination, ionised particles (e.g. electrons, protons) combined to form neutral atoms. At this stage, the matter density was such that photons only had a short path length before they would interact with an ionised particle, making the Universe opaque. As recombination progressed, and ionised particles combined into neutral atoms, the photon path length increased, making the Universe transparent to photons. The decoupled photons produced during this time have been redshifted by the expansion of the Universe, so we now observe them as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Dark Ages \\((380,000 \\text{ years}&lt; t &lt; 1\\text{ Gyr})\\) At this time, photons were free to stream through the Universe. However, light-producing systems such as stars had not yet formed, so the Universe was &quot;dark&quot;. The only sources of photons were those from the CMB, and those emitted from neutral Hydrogen atoms at 21 cm. Formation of structure \\((150\\text{ Myr} &lt; t &lt; 1\\text{ Gyr})\\) Structure forms hierarchically in the Universe; smaller structures form first and are built up into larger ones. The first structures to form in the Universe were stars, dwarf galaxies, and quasars. The first population of stars (Population III stars) are thought to have formed around t \\(=700\\) Myr. Pop III stars are yet to be detected observationally. Epoch of reionisation \\((250 \\text{ Myr} &lt; t 1\\text{ Gyr})\\) Pop III stars introduced a new source of radiation into the Universe. During the epoch of reionisation this radiation ionised the neutral Hydrogen, creating a plasma of protons and electrons. The epoch of reionisation most likely lasted until around 1 Gyr, when the Population III stars died off. At this time, the ionised Hydrogen gradually recombined to neutral Hydrogen once more. Formation of Galaxies and Clusters \\((t\\)&gt;\\(1 \\text{ Gyr})\\) &quot;Large&quot; galaxies and galaxy clusters formed from around t = 1 Gyr. These would have first comprised Population II stars, which, unlike Pop III stars, we do observe today. Later, the next generation of stars, Pop I, formed. Dark Energy epoch \\((t &gt; 9.8 \\text{ Gyr})\\) We are currently believed to be in the dark energy epoch, where the energy density of the Universe is dominated by the dark energy contribution. While we don’t know the nature of dark energy, its effects are seen as driving the expansion of the Universe so it is not just getting larger, but the expansion itself is accelerating. 1.5 The Expanding Universe The first observational evidence that the Universe is expanding was found by Edwin Hubble (Hubble 1929). By measuring the distances to nearby galaxies using the Cepheid Leavitt Law, and comparing these distances to the galaxies’ redshifts. Hubble measured the expansion rate of the Universe (the Hubble constant, \\(\\mathbf{H_0}\\)) to be approximately 500 km s\\(^{-1}\\) Mpc\\(^{-1}\\). Hubble’s observations are shown in Figure 1.3. Throughout this course we will explore how observations of the Universe have developed over the past century, increasing in precision and accuracy, leading to our current understanding of Cosmology. Figure 1.3: The first observational evidence of the expanding Universe. His first measurement of the expansion rate, now known as the Hubble constant, was 500 km s\\(^{-1}\\) Mpc\\(^{-1}\\).

The distance between two points is given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta s^2 = \\Delta x_{1}^{2} + \\Delta x_{2}^{2} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta x_{1}^{2}\\) and \\(\\Delta x_{2}^{2}\\) are the separations in the \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) coordinates. What about if we replaced the paper with a rubber sheet that can expand? The coordinate system \\(x_1\\)–\\(x_2\\) will expand with the sheet, and the physical distance between the points will change over time. Assuming that the expansion is uniform over the whole sheet, we now have \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta s^2 = a^2(t)\\left[\\Delta x_{1}^{2} + \\Delta x_{2}^{2}\\right] \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(a(t)\\) measures the rate of expansion. \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are comoving coordinates. Our current definition of \\(\\Delta s\\) only depends on the spatial distance between the points. However, in general relativity, we have to consider 4-dimensional space time, which may be curved. In this case, the distance becomes \\[\\begin{equation} ds^2 = \\sum_{\\mu, \\nu} g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^{\\mu} dx^{\\nu} \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the metric and \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\nu\\) are indices taking the values 0, 1, 2, 3. \\(x^{0}\\) is the time coordinate and \\(x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3}\\) are the spatial coordinates. The spatial component of Equation (2.3) can be simplified by applying the Cosmological Principle (see Sec. 1.1) - i.e. the Universe should not have any preferred locations. This means that the spatial component must have constant curvature at all positions. Changing to spherical polar coordinates, we now get \\[\\begin{equation} ds^2_3 = \\dfrac{dr^2}{1 - kr^2} + r^2\\left(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2\\right) \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(ds_3^2\\) considers only the spatial dimensions, and \\(k\\) is a constant which measures the curvature of space. Incorporating this into the space-time metric gives \\[\\begin{equation} ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a^2(t) \\left[\\dfrac{dr^2}{1 - kr^2} + r^2\\left(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2\\right)\\right] \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] Which is the Robertson-Walker metric. Here \\(a(t)\\) is the scale factor of the Universe - i.e. \\(a(t) = r/r_0,\\) where \\(r_0\\) is \\(r\\) at time \\(t_0\\). 2.2 The Einstein Equations The Robertson-Walker metric evolves according to Einstein’s equation: \\[\\begin{equation} R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\dfrac{1}{2}g_{\\mu\\nu}R = \\dfrac{8\\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu} \\tag{2.6} \\end{equation}\\] where \\({T_{\\mu\\nu}}\\) is the energy-momentum tensor of matter present, \\({R_{\\mu\\nu}}\\) is the Ricci tensor, and \\({R}\\) is the Ricci scalar. The Ricci components give the curvature of space-time. The energy-momentum tensor is assumed to be symmetric, meaning that there are potentially 10 Einstein equations. If \\(T_{\\mu\\nu}\\) has additional symmetries, then the number of equations is reduced. 2.3 Fluid equation We consider that any possible components of the Universe (e.g. matter, radiation) can be described as perfect fluids. Perfect fluids have no viscosity or heat flow, and their equations of state can be described using only density, \\(\\rho\\) and pressure, \\(P\\). Perfect fluids have a well known relation between energy, \\(E\\), pressure, \\(P\\), and temperature, \\(T\\): \\[\\begin{equation} dE + PdV = TdS \\tag{2.7} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(dV\\) is the change in volume, and \\(dS\\) is the change in entropy. If we consider a sphere of radius \\(a\\), using \\[\\begin{equation} E = mc^2 \\tag{2.8} \\end{equation}\\] we can relate the total energy contained within the sphere to its density via \\[\\begin{equation} E = \\dfrac{4\\pi}{3}a^3\\rho c^2 \\tag{2.9} \\end{equation}\\] Assuming that the sphere is expanding adiabatically, i.e. there is no change in entropy (\\(dS = 0\\)), differentiating Equation (2.7) with respect to \\(t\\) gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot{\\rho} + 3\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\left(\\rho + \\dfrac{P}{c^2}\\right) = 0 \\tag{2.10} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\dot{x} = \\dfrac{dx}{dt}, \\ddot{x} = \\dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2}\\), etc. Equation (2.10) is known as the fluid equation. As the energy of the perfect fluid depends only on \\(P\\) and \\(\\rho\\), the energy-momentum tensor for a perfect fluid is therefore \\[\\begin{equation} T_{\\mu\\nu} = \\text{diag}\\left(-\\rho c^2, P, P, P\\right) \\tag{2.11} \\end{equation}\\] This results in two independent Einstein equations, the time-time solution and the space-space solution. 2.4 Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar Deriving the full Ricci tensor is beyond the scope of this course. The following is provided for completeness. The components of the Ricci tensor that are not equal to zero are those where \\(\\mu = \\nu\\), such that \\(R_{tt} = -3\\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a}\\) \\(R_{rr} = \\dfrac{a\\ddot{a}}{1 - kr^2} + \\dfrac{2\\dot{a}^2}{1 - kr^2} + \\dfrac{2k}{1-kr^2}\\) \\(R_{\\theta\\theta} = r^2a\\ddot{a} + 2r^2\\dot{a}^2 + 2kr^2\\) \\(R_{\\phi\\phi} = r^2 a\\ddot{a}\\sin^2\\theta + 2r^2\\dot{a}^2\\sin^2\\theta + 2kr^2 \\sin^2\\theta\\) which simplifies to a diagonal tensor with \\[\\begin{equation} R_{tt}= -3\\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a} \\tag{2.12} \\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation} R_{ii} = \\dfrac{-g_{ii}}{a^2}\\left(a\\ddot{a} + 2\\dot{a}^2 + 2k\\right) \\tag{2.13} \\end{equation}\\] The Ricci scalar becomes \\[\\begin{equation} R = g_{ik}R_{ik} = - 6\\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a} - 6\\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 - 6\\dfrac{k}{a^2} \\tag{2.14} \\end{equation}\\] 2.5 Friedman Equation Using the time-time solution of the Einstein equation gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 + \\dfrac{kc^2}{a^2} = \\dfrac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho \\tag{2.15} \\end{equation}\\] which is the Friedman equation. The space-space solution follows in a similar way: \\[\\begin{equation} 2\\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a} + \\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 + \\dfrac{kc^2}{a^2} = -8\\pi G \\dfrac{P}{c^2} \\tag{2.16} \\end{equation}\\] Which looks odd right now, but by subtracting the Friedman equation (Eqn. (2.15)) we find: \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a} = -\\dfrac{4\\pi G}{3}\\left(\\rho + \\dfrac{3P}{c^2}\\right) \\tag{2.17} \\end{equation}\\] which is the known as the acceleration equation. 2.6 Natural units a.k.a. where have all the \\(c^2\\)’s gone? From this point forward, you will see that the factor \\(\\left(k c^2/a^2\\right)\\) in the Friedman equation will magically become \\(\\left(k/a^2\\right)\\). This is because we often like to use natural units in Cosmology. Mass density \\(\\left(\\rho\\right)\\) and energy density \\(\\left(\\epsilon\\right)\\) are often used interchangeably in Cosmology, and are related by \\(\\epsilon = \\rho c^2\\). By converting to natural units, i.e. setting \\(c=1\\), mass density and energy density are equivalent. As you will see later, many important cosmological parameters are expressed in dimensionless units (e.g. the density parameters, discussed in sections XXXX. So don’t worry about our missing \\(c^2\\) factor, it’s just another maths trick. 2.7 An alternative derivation of the Friedman equation The evolution of the scale factor, \\(a\\), can be derived using mostly Newtonian mechanics, in addition to two results from General Relativity: Birkhoff’s theorem – for a spherically symmetric system, the force due to gravity at radius \\(r\\) is determined only by the mass interior to \\(r\\). Energy contributes to the gravitating mass density, such that \\(E = \\rho_m + \\dfrac{u}{c^2}\\), where \\(\\rho_m\\) is the density of matter, and \\(u\\) is the energy density of radiation and relativistic particles. Consider a test particle on the surface of an expanding sphere of radius \\(r\\). From \\(F= m \\ddot{r}\\), its equation of motion can be shown to be \\[\\begin{equation} \\ddot{r} = -\\dfrac{4\\pi}{3} G \\rho r \\tag{2.18} \\end{equation}\\] Density is proportional to \\(r^{-3}\\), so by defining \\(r_{0} = 1\\), we find \\[\\rho = \\rho_{0}r^{-3}\\] Which can be substituted into Eqn. (2.18) to give: \\[\\begin{equation} \\ddot{r} = -\\dfrac{4\\pi}{3}\\dfrac{G\\rho_0}{r^2} \\tag{2.19} \\end{equation}\\] If \\(\\rho_0\\) is non-zero, then \\(\\ddot{r}\\) must also be non-zero. The Universe must either be expanding or contracting. To get Eqn. (2.19) into a useful form, we use some clever maths magic. First, multiply both sides by \\(\\dot{r}\\) to get: \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot{r}\\ddot{r} + \\dfrac{4\\pi}{3}\\dfrac{G\\rho_{0}}{r^2}\\dot{r} = 0 \\tag{2.20} \\end{equation}\\] We can use our mad differentiation skills to recognise that \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{d(\\dot{r}^2)}{dt} = 2\\dot{r}\\ddot{r} \\tag{2.21} \\end{equation}\\] Which leads to \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{1}{2}\\dfrac{d(\\dot{r}^2)}{dt} + \\dfrac{4\\pi G \\rho_0}{3} \\dfrac{1}{r^2}\\dfrac{dr}{dt} = 0 \\tag{2.22} \\end{equation}\\] Once again, we can use our handy \\(1^{st}\\) year maths skills to remind ourselves that \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{1}{r^2}\\dfrac{dr}{dt} = -\\dfrac{d(1/r)}{dt} \\tag{2.22} \\end{equation}\\] so we can simplify it further to \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left[\\dot{r}^2 - \\dfrac{(8\\pi G \\rho_0 / 3)}{r}\\right] = 0 \\tag{2.23} \\end{equation}\\] As Eqn (2.23) is equal to zero, the expression contained in the brackets must be constant: \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot{r}^2 - \\dfrac{(8\\pi G \\rho_0 / 3)}{r} = k \\tag{2.24} \\end{equation}\\] Our final step is to replace \\(\\rho_0\\) with \\(\\rho\\), and divide by \\(r^2\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{r}}{r}\\right)^2 - \\dfrac{8}{3}\\pi G \\rho = -\\dfrac{k}{r^2} \\tag{2.25} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} \\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{r}}{r}\\right)^2 + \\dfrac{k}{r^2} = \\dfrac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho \\tag{2.26} \\end{equation}\\] which is the same as the Friedman equation (Equation (2.15)), when \\(c=1\\). 2.8 The meaning of \\(k\\) In the previous sections, \\(k\\) has been used to describe the curvature of the Universe. \\(k\\) has three possible values: \\(k = 0\\): no curvature. If \\(k=0\\), then \\(\\dot{a}\\) will always be positive. The expansion will continue but will be slowing down, as \\(\\rho\\) will be decreasing. This is known as a flat Universe, or a critical Universe. \\(k = 1\\): positive curvature. If \\(k = 1\\), then \\(\\dot{a}\\) will initially be positive, but will reach a point where it changes sign. The Universe will expand to a certain point then collapse back in on itself (aka the big crunch). This is known as a closed Universe. \\(k = -1\\): negative curvature. If \\(k=-1\\) then \\(\\dot{a}\\) will always be positive and the expansion will continue forever (aka the big rip). This is known as an open Universe. :::fyi In some derivations \\(k\\) can have different values from those listed here. However, they will scale such that \\(k = -1, 0, 1\\). ::: 2.9 Exercises Confirm for yourself how the behaviour of \\(k\\) affects the evolution of the scale factor (\\(a\\)) over time. For \\(k=1\\), at what point does the Universe fall back in on itself? Sketch how the scale factor evolves with time for the three values of \\(k\\). How does the inclusion of a cosmological constant, \\(\\Lambda\\), change the Friedman equation? "],

In the previous section we decided that the Universe is a perfect fluid. We’re continuing with that assumption here, now looking at how the different components of the Universe behave. In Section 2.3 we stated that any possible components of the Universe could be described as perfect fluids. On a Cosmological scale, this is a reasonable assumption. However, not all Cosmological fluids behave in the same way. Each component will obey its own equation of state that describes how its pressure (\\(P\\)) and density (\\(\\rho\\)) are related. 3.1 Matter The simplest place to start is with the equation of state for matter, as that is the component that we are most familiar with. We know that for matter \\[P = 0\\] which we can substitute into the Fluid equation (Eqn. (2.10)) to find \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot{\\rho} + 3\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\rho = 0 \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] Again, using our amazing differentiation skillz, we can show that Eqn (3.1) can be rewritten as \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{1}{a^3}\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\rho a^3\\right) = 0 \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] This means that \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\rho a^3\\right) = 0 \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] or that \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho a^3 = \\text{constant,} \\text{ or }\\rho \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a^3} \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] This is not a surprising answer; it’s telling us that the density falls off with \\(a^3\\). We know that intuitively – if you keep the amount of material the same, but increase the volume, the density will fall off proportionally. We can rewrite this as \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho = \\dfrac{\\rho_0}{a^3} \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\rho_0\\) denotes the present day value. Now that we know how the density of the Universe evolves with the scale factor, we can look further into the fate of a “matter dominated” Universe. :::fyi Power laws In case you hadn’t realised by now, a lot of Cosmology is built on assumptions and estimation. Luckily, these estimates describe evolution of the Universe very well. One such estimate is the power law – the astronomers favourite tool for estimating relations. Power laws, e.g \\(a \\propto t^q\\) crop up frequently in astronomy and cosmology, so it’s useful to be able to recognise when to use them. Substituting Eqn. (3.4) into the Friedman equation (and assuming \\(k=0\\)) gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot{a}^2 = \\dfrac{8\\pi G \\rho_0}{3}\\dfrac{1}{a} \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] We can substitute in the power law \\(a \\propto t^q\\) to find a relation between \\(a\\), \\(\\rho\\) and \\(t\\): \\[\\begin{equation} t^{(2q-2)} \\propto t^{-q} \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] which gives us \\(q = 2/3\\), or \\[\\begin{align} a(t) &amp;= \\left(\\dfrac{t}{t_0}\\right)^{2/3}\\\\ \\rho(t) &amp;= \\dfrac{\\rho_0}{a^3} = \\dfrac{\\rho_0 t_{0}^{2}}{t^2} \\tag{3.7} \\end{align}\\] The Hubble parameter, \\(H(t)\\), is a measure of the expansion rate of the Universe at time \\(t\\) (note that \\(H(t)\\) is different to the Hubble constant, \\(H_0\\), which is a measure of the expansion rate at the present time). \\(H(t)\\) is therefore related to \\(a\\), and hence \\(t\\): \\[\\begin{equation} H(t) \\equiv \\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a} = \\dfrac{2}{3t} \\tag{3.8} \\end{equation}\\] As discussed in Section 2.8, we can see that in this \\(k=0\\), matter dominated Universe, the expansion will continue forever. It will slow down over time, becoming infinitely slow at \\(t=\\infty\\). ::: 3.2 Radiation The equation of state for radiation is \\[\\begin{equation} P = \\dfrac{\\rho c^2}{3} \\tag{3.9} \\end{equation}\\] which we can substitute into the Fluid equation (Eqn. (2.10)): \\[\\begin{align} \\dot{\\rho} + 3\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\left(\\rho + \\dfrac{\\rho c^2}{3}\\right) &amp;= 0\\\\ \\dot{\\rho} + 4\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\rho &amp;= 0 \\tag{3.10} \\end{align}\\] Using the same power law analysis as in Section 3.1, i.e. \\(a \\propto t^q\\), we find that \\(q = 1/2\\), leading to: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{lcr} \\rho \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a^4} &amp; \\qquad a(t) = \\left(\\dfrac{t}{t_0}\\right)^{1/2} &amp; \\qquad \\rho(t) = \\dfrac{\\rho_0}{a^4} = \\dfrac{\\rho_0 t_0^2}{t^2}\\\\ \\end{array} \\tag{3.11} \\end{equation}\\] In the radiation dominated case, \\(\\rho(t)\\) decreases with \\(t^2\\), as is the case with the matter dominated case. However, when we consider the scale factor, \\(a\\), we find: \\[H(t) \\equiv \\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a} = \\dfrac{1}{2t}\\] meaning that the Universe expands more slowly when it is radiation dominated than when it is matter dominated. This may seem counter-intuitive at first; for a matter dominated Universe the energy density is proportional to the volume of the Universe (\\(1/a^3\\)), so why is this not the same for a radiation dominated Universe? The answer lies in what happens to radiation under an increase in the scale factor. 3.3 Why does a radiation dominated Universe expand more slowly? As the Universe expands, the scale factor \\(a\\) increases. The energy density of the radiation will decrease proportionally as the volume increases. However, the radiation loses additional energy, proportional to \\(a\\), as the photons are redshifted. Figure 3.1: A photon travelling between two galaxies Consider a photon travelling between two points in space, as shown in Figure 3.1. The relative velocities of the galaxies in Fig. 3.1 is given by \\[\\begin{equation} dv = H dr = \\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a} dr \\tag{3.12} \\end{equation}\\] We can use the Doppler law to find the change of the photon’s wavelength, \\(d\\lambda\\), while it’s travelling between the two positions \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{d\\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\dfrac{dv}{c} \\tag{3.13} \\end{equation}\\] The travel time of the photon is \\(dt = dr/c\\), which we can combine with Equations (3.12) and (3.13) to find \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{d\\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a} \\dfrac{dr}{c} = \\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a} dt \\tag{3.14} \\end{equation}\\] Integrating Equation (3.14) shows that \\(\\ln \\lambda = \\ln a + \\text{constant}\\), i.e. \\[\\begin{equation} \\lambda \\propto a \\tag{3.15} \\end{equation}\\] The energy of a photon is proportional to its wavelength, so \\[\\begin{equation} E = \\dfrac{h c}{\\lambda} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a} \\tag{3.16} \\end{equation}\\] This reduction in energy by an additional factor of \\(a\\) accounts for the slowed expansion in a radiation dominated Universe. 3.4 Mixing matter and radiation In Sections 3.1 and 3.2 we considered the cases where the Universe was composed of either only matter or only radiation. This is not particularly realistic; the Universe contains a mixture of these two components. We found that the energy densities of matter and radiation are related to the scale factor by different amounts, with the radiation energy density decreasing more quickly as \\(a\\) increases: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{lr} \\rho_{\\text{mat}} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a^3} &amp; \\qquad \\rho_{\\text{rad}} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a^4} \\end{array} \\tag{3.17} \\end{equation}\\] Even though the Universe is a mixture of matter and radiation, it still obeys the Friedman equation (Eqn. (2.15)) in the same way, with the individual densities combined into a single value of \\(\\rho\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho = \\rho_{\\text{mat}} + \\rho_{\\text{rad}} \\tag{3.18} \\end{equation}\\] We could solve the Friedman equation in full, but in practice only the dominant density term significantly affects the evolution of the scale factor at any given time. At early times, the radiation energy density will dominate over the matter energy density, meaning that \\(a\\) will evolve as in the radiation case: \\[\\begin{equation} a(t) \\propto t^{1/2} \\tag{3.19} \\end{equation}\\] Combining this with our individual equations for \\(\\rho(t)\\) we find \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho_{\\text{rad}} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{t^2} \\tag{3.20} \\end{equation}\\] for the radiation dominated case, and \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho_{\\text{mat}} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a^3} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{t^{3/2}} \\tag{3.21} \\end{equation}\\] for the matter dominated case. Figure 3.2: Evolution of the matter (orange solid line) and radiation (blue dashed line) density components as a function of time in a mixed composition Universe. Radiation dominates for early times, but as \\(t\\) (hence \\(a\\)) increases, matter becomes the dominant component. Initially, radiation will dominate. However, as \\(t\\) increases, the energy density contribution from matter will dominate over radiation, as shown in Figure 3.2. However, when the matter density dominates, \\(a\\) will evolve as in the matter case: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{lcr} a(t) \\propto t^{2/3} &amp; \\qquad \\rho_{\\text{mat}} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{t^2} &amp; \\qquad \\rho_{\\text{rad}} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a^4} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{t^{8/3}} \\end{array} \\tag{3.22} \\end{equation}\\] 3.5 Cosmological Constant The final case that we haven’t considered is the contribution from the cosmological constant, \\(\\Lambda\\) and its density \\(\\rho_{\\Lambda}\\). We know from observations that the Universe is now in the \\(\\Lambda\\) (Dark Energy) dominated era, but what does that mean for its evolution? The fluid equation for \\(\\Lambda\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot{\\rho_{\\Lambda}} + 3\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a} \\left(\\rho_{\\Lambda} + \\dfrac{P_{\\Lambda}}{c^2}\\right) = 0 \\tag{3.23} \\end{equation}\\] We know that \\(\\rho_{\\Lambda}\\) is constant over time, which leads to \\[\\begin{equation} P_\\Lambda = -\\rho_{\\Lambda}c^2 \\tag{3.24} \\end{equation}\\] This means that \\(\\Lambda\\) has a negative effective pressure. As Universe expands, work is done on the \\(\\Lambda\\) fluid, allowing its density to stay constant even as the Universe increases in volume. We’ll come back to the ridiculousness of \\(\\Lambda\\) later in the course. 3.6 Exercises So far we’ve looked at the cases for matter, where \\(P = 0\\), and radiation, where \\(P = \\rho c^2 / 3\\). Consider a generic equation of state where \\(P = (\\gamma - 1) \\rho c^2\\), where \\(0 &lt; \\gamma &lt; 2\\). Find equations for \\(\\rho(a)\\), \\(a(t)\\) and \\(\\rho(t)\\) for this equation of state. Assume a flat Universe, i.e. \\(k=0\\). Recall the Friedman equation: \\[\\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 = \\dfrac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho - \\dfrac{k}{a^2}\\] Considering the equations you derived in part 1, what value of \\(\\gamma\\) is required so that \\(\\rho\\) has the same time dependence as the curvature term, \\(k/a^2\\)? Assuming \\(k&lt;0\\), find the solution \\(a(t)\\) to the Friedman equation for a fluid with the value of \\(\\gamma\\) you derived in Section 2.9. "],

Such models are specified by a number of parameters, such as the densities of radiation and matter, the Universe’s curvature, and the Hubble parameter, to name a few. These parameters are measured observationally to determine which cosmological model best describes the Universe, with different experiments being able to constrain different parameters. The most widely accepted cosmological model is known as \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM, which describes a Universe with two key features: 1. The energy density of dark matter is dominated by cold dark matter (i.e. non-relativistic particles) 2. The total energy density contains a significant contribution from the cosmological constant \\(\\Lambda\\), which we ascribe to dark energy. We will now look at the main observational parameters in today’s cosmological models. 4.2 The Hubble Constant \\(H_{0}\\) The Hubble constant (\\(H_{0}\\)) is a measurement of the current expansion rate of the Universe. In cosmological models it is often expressed as the dimensionless parameter \\(h\\), where \\[\\begin{equation} H_0 = 100 h \\text{km s}^{-1} \\text{Mpc}^{-1} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\(H_{0}\\) is measured by comparing distances of objects to their redshifts, such that \\[\\begin{equation} H_0 = \\dfrac{v}{r} \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(v\\) and \\(r\\) are the recession velocities (redshifts) and distances of a sample of objects, such as supernova host galaxies. The first measurement of \\(H_0\\) was made by Hubble in 1929 (see Sec. @ref(sec:expanding_intro)). Since then, many measurements of \\(H_0\\) have been made using large samples of galaxies out to higher and higher redshifts. We will cover the details of these experiments in the Observational Techniques section. We can also use measurements of \\(H_0\\) to estimate the age of the Universe. As we showed in Chapter 3, \\[\\begin{equation} H(t) = \\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a} \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] By substituting \\(\\dot{a}\\) and \\(a\\) for their values now to get \\(H_0\\) (i.e. \\(H_{t_0}\\)), we find that the age of the Universe, assuming that matter dominates the energy density, is \\[\\begin{equation} H(t) = \\dfrac{2}{3t} \\tag{4.4} \\end{equation}\\] This is a rough estimate, as at early times the Universe was not matter dominated (and it may not be now either!), but it gives a reasonable guess. 4.3 The Density Parameter \\(\\Omega_{0}\\) The density parameter, \\(\\Omega_0\\) specifies the energy density of the Universe. To understand the meaning of \\(\\Omega_0\\), we go back to our old friend, the Friedman equation: \\[\\begin{equation} H(t)^2 = \\dfrac{8\\pi G \\rho}{3} - \\dfrac{k}{a^2} = \\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 \\tag{4.5} \\end{equation}\\] This tells us that for a given value of \\(H(t)\\), there is a specific value of the density \\(\\rho\\) that will make the Universe flat (i.e. \\(k=0\\)). This value of the density is known as the critical density, \\(\\rho_c\\). \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho_c(t) = \\dfrac{3 H^2}{8 \\pi G} \\tag{4.6} \\end{equation}\\] Importantly, Eq. (4.6) tells us that the critical density is time dependent. We can simplify Eq. (4.6) to define it in terms of \\(h\\) (the only time dependent parameter). Plugging in all the values of the constants, we find \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho_c(t_0) = 1.88 h^2 \\times 10^{-26} \\text{kg m}^{-3} \\tag{4.7} \\end{equation}\\] It’s useful to compare this to something we can physically comprehend. For example, the density of water is \\(\\rho_{water} = 10^3 \\text{kg m}^{-3}\\), so \\(\\rho_c\\) is \\(10^{29}\\) times less dense than water! But why is this important? It’s important because if the average density of the Universe \\(\\rho\\) becomes larger than \\(\\rho_c\\), the Universe becomes closed, i.e. \\(k\\) will be greater than 0, and Universe will end in a big crunch. Not a particularly inviting prospect. We can do another quick estimation to see if we should be worried. First, we put \\(\\rho_c\\) into more appropriate units of solar masses and megaparsecs: \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho_c(t_0) = \\dfrac{2.78 h^{-1} \\times 10^{11} M_\\odot}{\\left(h^{-1} \\text{Mpc}\\right)^3} \\tag{4.8} \\end{equation}\\] We can compare this to what we observe in the Universe. A typical galaxy has a mass of around \\(10^{11}\\) to \\(10^{12} M_{\\odot}\\), and the typical separation between galaxies is of the order of 1~Mpc. So our estimate for \\(\\rho_c\\) in Eq. (4.8) seems fairly realistic! Our Universe could be flat after all (phew!) 4.4 Does the Universe need to be flat? In the section above we’ve said that the critical density is that for which the Universe is flat. But there’s nothing in the Cosmological Principle that forces flatness. Quite the opposite in fact; \\(k\\) is not restricted to be equal to zero. It is useful to characterise the density of the Universe relative to the critical density, rather than an absolute value, \\[\\begin{equation} \\Omega(t) \\equiv \\dfrac{\\rho}{\\rho_c} \\tag{4.9} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Omega(t)\\) is dimensionless, similar to \\(h\\). The present day value of \\(\\Omega(t)\\) is denoted by \\(\\Omega_0\\), such that \\[\\begin{equation} \\Omega_0 = \\dfrac{\\rho_0}{\\rho_c} \\tag{4.10} \\end{equation}\\] We can substitute Eqs. (4.6) and (4.10) into the Friedman equation (Eq. (4.5)) to find a relationship between \\(\\Omega\\), \\(H\\), and \\(k\\). First we find \\[\\begin{equation} H(t)^2 = \\dfrac{8\\pi G \\rho_c \\Omega}{3} - \\dfrac{k}{a^2} \\tag{4.11} \\end{equation}\\] by putting Eq. (4.10) into Eq. (4.5). Then, substituting in Eq. (4.6), we find \\[\\begin{equation} H(t)^2 = H^2 \\Omega - \\dfrac{k}{a^2} \\tag{4.12} \\end{equation}\\] which we can rearrange to get \\[\\begin{equation} \\Omega - 1 = \\dfrac{k}{a^2 H^2} \\tag{4.13} \\end{equation}\\] This tells us the same thing as in the previous section – that if \\(\\Omega = 1\\) (i.e. \\(\\rho = \\rho_c\\)) then we have a critical density Universe and \\(k=0\\). If \\(\\Omega \\neq 1\\) then we can use Eq. (4.13) to see how the density has evolved with time. As discussed for density in Section 3.4, the density parameter \\(\\Omega\\) can be separated into its different components, for example \\[\\begin{equation} \\Omega = \\Omega_{m} + \\Omega_{r} \\tag{4.14} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Omega_m\\) and \\(\\Omega_r\\) are the density parameters for matter and radiation, and \\(\\Omega\\) is the total density parameter. Additionally, curvature can contribute to the total density parameter, via the equation \\[\\begin{equation} \\Omega_k = \\dfrac{-k}{a^2 H^2} \\tag{4.15} \\end{equation}\\] and, importantly, \\(\\Omega_k\\) can be positive or negative!. We can substitute these into the Friedman equation again (seriously, if in doubt, substitute into the Friedman equation…) to get: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Omega + \\Omega_k = 1 \\tag{4.15} \\end{equation}\\] We’ll return to the density parameter in more detail in later sections, when we look at how it is measured and how it affects the \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM model. 4.5 The Deceleration Parameter, \\(q_0\\) The Hubble parameter \\(H(t)\\) describes the time dependence of the expansion of the Universe. The deceleration parameter, \\(q_0\\) quantifies how the expansion rate changes over time. The derivation of the deceleration parameter is not examinable. We start our exploration of the deceleration parameter by looking at a Taylor expansion of the scale factor at the present time, i.e. \\(a_0\\). \\[\\begin{equation} a(t) = a(t_0) + \\dot{a}(t_0)[t - t_0] + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\ddot{a}(t_0)[t-t_0]^2 ... \\tag{4.16} \\end{equation}\\] Dividing (4.16) by \\(a(t_0)\\) gives us \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{a(t)}{a(t_0)} = 1 + \\dfrac{\\dot{a}(t_0)}{ a(t_0)}[t - t_0] + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\dfrac{\\ddot{a}(t_0)}{a(t_0)}[t-t_0]^2 \\tag{4.17} \\end{equation}\\] which we can re-write as \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{a(t)}{a(t_0)} = 1 + H_0 [t - t_0] + \\dfrac{q_0}{2}H_0^2[t-t_0]^2 \\tag{4.18} \\end{equation}\\] Where the deceleration parameter \\(q_0\\) is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} q_0 = \\dfrac{-\\ddot{a}(t_0)}{a(t_0)}\\dfrac{1}{H^2} \\tag{4.19} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} q_0 = \\dfrac{a(t_0) \\ddot{a}(t_0)}{\\dot{a}^2(t_0)} \\tag{4.20} \\end{equation}\\] which means that a higher value of \\(q_0\\) means more rapid deceleration. In Section 2.5 we came across the acceleration equation \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a} = -\\dfrac{4\\pi G}{3}\\left(\\rho + \\dfrac{3P}{c^2}\\right) \\tag{4.21} \\end{equation}\\] (Note - I did not cover this derivation in the recorded lecture, but it is in the written notes). Assuming the simplest case, that the Universe is matter dominated (i.e. \\(P=0\\)), Eq. (4.21) becomes \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a} = -\\dfrac{4\\pi G}{3}\\rho \\tag{4.22} \\end{equation}\\] Substituting in Eq. (4.19), we find \\[\\begin{equation} q_0 = -\\dfrac{\\ddot{a}(t_0)}{a(t_0)} H_0^2 = \\dfrac{4\\pi G}{3}\\rho \\tag{4.22} \\end{equation}\\] And remembering the equations for the critical density \\(\\rho_c\\) (Eq. (4.6)) and the density parameter \\(\\Omega\\) (Eq. (4.9)), we find \\[\\begin{equation} q_0 = \\dfrac{4\\pi G}{3}\\rho \\dfrac{3}{8 \\pi G \\rho_c} \\tag{4.23} \\end{equation}\\] which (after all that….) simplifies to \\[\\begin{equation} q_0 = \\dfrac{\\Omega_0}{2} \\tag{4.24} \\end{equation}\\] So the deceleration parameter doesn’t just tell us about the expansion rate, it also gives us the density parameter!! 4.6 Measuring \\(q_0\\) In the section above, we have shown that \\(q_0\\) is dependent on both \\(H_0\\) and \\(\\Omega_0\\). That means that if we can measure \\(H_0\\) and \\(\\Omega_0\\), then we should be able to describe the Universe. Right?? No. The problem is we don’t know everything about the Universe. Specifically, we don’t know \\(\\Omega_0\\). However, \\(q_0\\) can tell us about the Universe in a different way. We can measure \\(q_0\\) by looking at distant galaxies. And, as we know, looking at more distant (i.e. high redshift) galaxies, is looking back to earlier times in the Universe’s evolution. The first measurements of \\(q_0\\) were made in the 1990’s by looking at Type Ia supernovae (there’ll be more on this in the observational techniques section.) One of the main publications to come out of these experiments was Riess et al. (1998), who found that \\(q_0\\) was negative. This means that the expansion of the Universe is not decelerating, but is accelerating!!, Adam Riess, Brian Schmidt and Saul Perlmutter were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for this discovery a few years ago. If we take a look at the acceleration equation again \\[\\begin{equation} \\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a} = -\\dfrac{4\\pi G}{3}\\left(\\rho + \\dfrac{3P}{c^2}\\right) \\tag{4.25} \\end{equation}\\] we can try to figure out what is going on. If we assume the matter equation of state again (\\(P=0\\)), then the left hand side of Eq. (4.25) will always be negative. The Universe’s expansion will decelerate. If we assume a different equation of state, for example, one with a similar form to that of radiation such that \\(P&gt;0\\), then we find the same thing. The left hand side of Eq. (4.25) will always be negative. The Universe’s expansion will decelerate. (You can see now why they called it the deceleration parameter…) In fact, the only way we can get a Universe where the expansion is accelerating is if it’s dominant component has a very strange equation of state with negative pressure! 4.7 The Cosmological Constant At the end of Lecture 3 we looked briefly at the Cosmological Constant (\\(\\Lambda\\)). Einstein introduced \\(\\Lambda\\) into general relativity in order to create a ‘static’ Universe – one that was neither expanding or contracting. His assumption was that as all matter interacts via gravity then there is no solution to the Friedman equation that permits \\(\\dot{a} = 0\\). To counteract this, he added in the \\(\\Lambda\\) term so that the \\(\\dot{a} = 0\\) solution would be permitted, making the Friedman equation become \\[\\begin{equation} H^2 = \\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 = \\dfrac{8 \\pi G \\rho}{3} - \\dfrac{k}{a^2} + \\dfrac{\\Lambda}{3} \\tag{4.26} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Lambda\\) has units of time\\(^{-2}\\). A full derivation of the acceleration equation including \\(\\Lambda\\) is quite dry so I won’t include it here. You’re welcome to try it yourself (or see the PDF of the slides on moodle). The important point to take away is that if \\(\\Lambda\\) is positive, then it provides a positive repulsive force to drive the expansion. The density related to \\(\\Lambda\\) follows the same rules as other densities, i.e. \\[\\begin{equation} \\Omega + \\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 1 \\tag{4.27} \\end{equation}\\] in a flat Universe, where \\[\\begin{equation} \\Omega_{\\Lambda} = \\dfrac{\\Lambda}{3H^2} \\tag{4.28} \\end{equation}\\] We can treat \\(\\Lambda\\) as a fluid, similarly to the treatment we did for matter and radiation. Taking the Friedman equation (Eq. (4.26)) and the density (Eq. (4.28)) we can show that \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho_{\\Lambda} = \\dfrac{\\Lambda}{8 \\pi G} \\tag{4.29} \\end{equation}\\] to give \\[\\begin{equation} H^2 = \\dfrac{8 \\pi G}{3}(\\rho + \\rho_{\\Lambda}) - \\dfrac{k}{a^2} \\tag{4.30} \\end{equation}\\] Finally, we can look at the Fluid equation (aha! you thought I was going to say the Friedman equation!) to find the equation of state for \\(\\Lambda\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot{\\rho_{\\Lambda}} + 3\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\left(\\rho_{\\Lambda} + \\dfrac{P}{c^2}\\right) = 0 \\tag{4.31} \\end{equation}\\] As \\(\\Lambda\\) is the cosmological constant, hence does not change with time, we know that \\(\\dot{\\rho_{\\Lambda}} = 0\\). Rearranging Eq. (4.31) gives us: \\[\\begin{equation} P_{\\Lambda} = -\\rho_{\\Lambda} c^2 \\tag{4.32} \\end{equation}\\] The cosmological constant has negative pressure!! What does this mean physically? It means that as the Universe expands, work is done on the \\(\\Lambda\\) fluid and its energy density remains constant. The generic form of the \\(\\Lambda\\) equation of state is \\[\\begin{equation} P_{\\Lambda} = w \\rho_{\\Lambda} c^2 \\tag{4.32} \\end{equation}\\] and you will often see the parameter \\(w\\) referred to as the dark energy equation of state. We will revisit the evidence for \\(\\Lambda\\), and measurements of the other parameters discussed in this section soon. "],

In this section we will investigate the link between the models that describe the expanding Universe and the observations that allow us to measure their parameters. 5.1 Equations to Observations As we have seen in the previous sections, the Friedman equation is the foundation of Cosmology: \\[\\begin{equation} \\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 + \\dfrac{kc^2}{a^2} = \\dfrac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] In Section 3.1, we showed that the scale factor, \\(a\\), evolves as \\[\\begin{equation} a(t) = \\left(\\dfrac{t}{t_0}\\right)^{2/3} \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] in a matter-dominated Universe, leading us to the Hubble parameter, \\(H(t)\\): \\[\\begin{equation} H(t) \\equiv \\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a} = \\dfrac{2}{3t} \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] An accurate and precise measurement of \\(H(t)\\) will tell us how \\(a\\) changes over time. Additionally, measuring \\(H(t_0)\\), more commonly written as \\(H_0\\) (the Hubble constant), gives us an estimate of the age of the Universe. The longest established route for measuring \\(H_0\\) is via the distance ladder. The distance ladder ties together various standard candles in order to estimate the distances of increasingly distant objects. 5.2 Standard candle measurements of \\(H_0\\) Standard candles are astronomical objects of known intrinsic brightness. Examples of standard candles are objects such as type Ia supernovae, or Cepheid variable stars. Cepheids are standard candles as they have a well-defined relationship between their intrinsic brightness (or absolute magnitude) and their period of variation. This relation is known as the Leavitt law (Leavitt and Pickering 1912), but you may also see it referred to as the period-luminosity relation. Figure 5.1 shows the Leavitt laws for a selection of Cepheids in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Figure 5.1: Leavitt laws for Cepheids in the Small Magellanic Cloud observed at optical (purple, bottom) to mid-infrared (pink, top) wavelengths. There is a clear relation between period and luminosity, with the relation tightening and steepening as we move to longer wavelengths. The relations are offset so these changes can be seen. Adapted from Scowcroft et al. (2016). By comparing the apparent magnitude of a standard candle with it’s absolute magnitude we can obtain its distance: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mu = m - M = 5 \\log(d) - 5 \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is the distance modulus, \\(m\\) is the apparent magnitude, \\(M\\) is the absolute magnitude, and \\(d\\) is the distance in parsecs. In the case of Cepheids, we observe the star’s apparent magnitude and calculate its absolute magnitude using the Leavitt law. The Leavitt law takes the form \\[\\begin{equation} M_{\\lambda} = a_{\\lambda} \\log(P) + b_{\\lambda} \\tag{5.5} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(M_{\\lambda}\\) is the absolute magnitude at wavelength \\(\\lambda\\), and \\(a_{\\lambda}\\) and \\(b_{\\lambda}\\) are the slope and intercept of the relation. Figure 5.1 shows how the slope (\\(a\\)) and intercept (\\(b\\)) change with wavelength, with \\(a\\) becoming increasingly negative as we move to longer wavelengths. Moving to longer wavelengths to measure Cepheid distances is advantageous for several reasons. First, effects of reddening and extinction on apparent magnitudes are dramatically reduced compared to optical wavelengths. Second, the Leavitt law has smaller dispersion – i.e. the standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\) of the points around the Leavitt law is smaller, and the amplitude of their light curves are smaller (see Figure 5.2. This means that distances obtained from redder wavelengths are more accurate than those from shorter wavelength observations. Figure 5.2: Multiwavelength light curves for Milky Way Cepheid CD Cyg. The light curves become more sinusoidal and smaller in amplitude as you move from blue to red wavelengths. 5.3 Calibration of standard candles Standard candles are useful as they are objects of known intrinsic luminosity. But how do we know their intrinsic luminosity? To determine the intrinsic luminosity of a standard candle, we must have a calibration sample for which we know the objects distance in addition to their apparent magnitudes. In the case of variable stars, this is done using parallax measurements of objects within the Milky way. 5.4 Parallax calibration of standard candles Parallax is a geometric distance determination. Distances are estimated by measuring how the positions of objects change over time with respect to a reference frame of distant, background objects. Figure 5.3: Schematic of the parallax method (not to scale). Distances are determined by measuring the apparent angular shift of nearby objects compared to an seemingly static background of distant objects. Observations are separated by six months (i.e. opposite sides of the Earth’s orbit) in order to maximise the baseline of the observations. Figure 5.3 illustrates how parallax distance determinations are made. The positions of target stars relative to distant, background objects are measured. Observations are separated by six months, in order to maximise the baseline of the observations. The parallax angle, \\(\\varpi = \\left(\\theta / 2\\right)\\) is used to calculate the distance via simple trigonometry: \\[\\begin{equation} d = \\dfrac{r}{\\tan(\\varpi)} \\tag{5.6} \\end{equation}\\] As the parallax angle, \\(\\varpi\\), is extremely small, and the baseline length is much smaller than the distance of the target object \\(\\left(\\text{i.e. }r \\ll d \\right)\\), Eq. (5.6) can be simplified to: \\[\\begin{equation} d = \\dfrac{1}{\\varpi} \\tag{5.7} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(d\\) is the distance of the target in parsecs. In the case of the distance ladder, parallax distances of Cepheids are used to fix the intercept, or zero-point, of the Leavitt law. Until recently only 10 Cepheids with high-precision parallaxes were available for this calibration. However, the Gaia mission promises to dramatically improve this situation. Gaia is a European Space Agency mission which is measuring the parallaxes of over one billion stars in the Milky Way and its nearest neighbours to extremely high precision. The precision of Gaia is such that if we put it on top of Buckingham Palace it could resolve a human hair on top of the Empire State Building, over 5,500 km away. Gaia’s parallax catalogue will contain many thousands of Cepheids that could potentially be included in the Leavitt law calibration. 5.5 The Distance Ladder With the Leavitt law calibrated, we can now measure distances to objects outside of our own Galaxy. However, although Cepheids are bright stars, we cannot observe them in very distant galaxies. In order to measure distances to the furthest objects we must use different techniques, each calibrated to our parallax zero-point. Tying together different methods to estimate distances to progressively further objects is known as the distance ladder. Figure 5.4 shows how the techniques tie together to measure \\(H_0\\). Figure 5.4: The distance ladder. The bottom rung of the distance ladder is established by measuring parallax distances to Cepheids within our own Galaxy. Cepheids are measured in increasingly distant galaxies in order to calibrate the absolute scale of techniques such as the Tully Fisher relation and Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). The Hubble constant is measured using the recession velocities (redshift) and distances of SN Ia in the furthest galaxies, where contribution of peculiar velocities is minimized. To get an accurate measurement of \\(H_0\\) we must use objects that are as far away as possible. If we were to use only galaxies that were nearby in our estimation then the velocities we measure would be dominated by peculiar motions. Peculiar motions are caused by gravitational interaction with other nearby objects. For very distant galaxies – those deemed to be in the Hubble flow – the galaxy’s velocity is dominated by its recession velocity, and the contribution from the peculiar velocity is negligible. 5.6 Measurements of \\(H_0\\) from the distance ladder The distance ladder is one of the oldest and most frequently used techniques to measure \\(H_0\\). Figure 5.5 shows how our measurements of \\(H_0\\) have converged over time, from the early measurements in the 1930’s, to the high-precision measurements of the 2010’s and 2020’s. From Figure~ it looks like we may have reached a consensus on the value of \\(H_0\\). To confirm that, we need to consider the uncertainties on our measurements. Figure 5.5: Measurements of \\(H_0\\) as a function of time. Hubble’s original measurement [1929Hubble] was around 500 km s\\(^{-1}\\) Mpc\\(^{-1}\\). Over the last one-hundred years, we appear to have reached a consensus that \\(H_{0}\\) is approximately 70 km s\\(^{-1}\\) Mpc\\(^{-1}\\), although recent high precision measurements have brought that consensus into question. 5.7 Uncertainties in the distance ladder There are two types of uncertainties that can be present in a result – systematic and random. A comparison of the two and their effects on the precision and accuracy of a measurement are shown in Table 5.1 and Figure 5.6. Table 5.1: Comparison of systematic and random uncertainties Systematic Random Affects all data points the same way Affects each point differently Often assumed to have Gaussian distribution Causes offsets Causes dispersion Affects accuracy Affects precision Doesn’t decrease with \\(N_{\\text{obs}}\\) Decreases with \\(\\sqrt{N_{\\text{obs}}}\\) Figure 5.6: The effect of systematic and random uncertainties on accuracy and precision. The distance ladder ties together several techniques to measure distances to the furthest galaxies, hence uncertainties on each “rung” of the ladder propagate through to our final measurements. Large uncertainties at the bottom will lead to unreliable measurements at the top, in a similar way to having an unstable foundation for the bottom of a ladder leads to an unstable, wobbly ladder that you really wouldn’t want to stand at the top of. A major step forward in measuring a high-precision value of \\(H_0\\) was made in 2001 with the publication of the results from the HST Key Project to Measure the Hubble Constant [2001Freedman], who found \\(H_0\\) = 71\\(\\pm\\)2(rand.)\\(\\pm\\)6(sys.) kms\\(^{-1}\\)Mpc\\(^{-1}\\). Table 5.2 shows how different components of systematic uncertainty combine in their final result. Table 5.2: Overall systematic uncertainties in the Hubble constant. From (Freedman et al. 2001). Source of uncertainty Method of estimation Error (%) LMC zero point Error on mean from Cepheids, TRGB, SN 1987A, red clump, eclipsing binaries \\(\\pm\\) 5 HST camera calibration Tie-in to Galactic star clusters \\(\\pm\\) 3.5 Reddening Limits from photometry \\(\\pm\\) 1 Metallicity Observational and theoretical constraints \\(\\pm\\) 4 Bias in Leavitt law Short-end period cut-off \\(\\pm\\) 1 Crowding Artificial star experiments +5, -0 Large scale flows Limits from SN Ia, CMB \\(\\pm\\) 5 In the years since the HST Key Project, these uncertainties have been further reduced. One of the highest precision measurements of \\(H_0\\) to date comes from the SH\\(_{0}\\)ES experiment (Riess et al. 2016), who found \\(H_0= 73.24 \\pm 1.74\\) km s\\(^{-1}\\)~Mpc\\(^{-1}\\). Figure 5.7 shows the breakdown of their uncertainty budget. Figure 5.7: Uncertainty budget from the SH\\(_{0}\\)ES experiment (Riess et al. 2016). One of the largest uncertainties remaining in distance ladder measurements of \\(H_0\\) comes from the bottom rung of the ladder. In the Key Project, the ladder was tied to our nearest galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). SH\\(_{0}\\)ES reduced this uncertainty by tying their calibration to the Cepheids in the LMC (which can all be assumed to be at the same distance), Cepheids with parallaxes in the Milky Way (MW), and Cepheids in the mega-maser host galaxy NGC4258. :::fyi Astrophysical masers are sources of stimulated microwave emission, similar to lasers. Mega-masers are astrophysical masers with very high isotropic luminosities. Mega-masers are excellent geometric distance indicators. By assuming that the maser is travelling round a galaxy with a Keplerian orbit we can calculate the intrinsic size of the system. Comparing this with its apparent size gives us an estimate of the distance. ::: Until recently, only a handful of MW Cepheids had high-precision parallax measurements. The ESA Gaia mission will change this in the coming years by measuring high-precision parallaxes for over 1~billion stars in the MW. The Gaia sample will include several thousand Cepheids which can then be used to anchor the distance ladder. Figure 5.8 shows the sky as seen by Gaia. Each star in this image has a parallax measurement, including those in the Magellanic Clouds (seen to the bottom right of the Galactic Plane). Figure 5.8: The Gaia sky in colour. Credit: ESA/Gaia/DPAC, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO. In order to properly calibrate the Leavitt law and the uncertainties it contributes to the distance ladder, the Gaia Cepheid parallaxes must be treated extremely carefully. When using small samples of Cepheids with reasonably small uncertainties, it is appropriate to estimate the parallax distance (\\(r\\)) as \\[\\begin{equation} r = \\dfrac{1}{\\varpi} \\tag{5.8} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\varpi\\) is the parallax angle. However, if we wish to ensure an unbiased calibration of the Leavitt law, we must not truncate the Cepheid sample with limits on (a) parallax uncertainty (\\(\\sigma_{\\varpi}\\)) or (b) apparent magnitude. As there is an inverse relation between parallax and distance, the probability distribution of distances for a given parallax angle is skewed, becoming more so as the fractional uncertainty \\({f}_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\sigma_{\\varpi}/\\varpi\\) increases. This is illustrated in Figure 5.9. Figure 5.9: Left panel is the probability \\(P(\\varpi | r,{\\sigma }_{\\varpi })\\) as a function of \\(\\varpi\\). The middle panel is \\(P(\\varpi | r,{\\sigma }_{\\varpi })\\) as a function of \\(r\\) for an object with \\({f}_{obs}=0.2\\), and the right panel is as the middle panel but for \\({f}_{obs}=0.5\\), where. \\({f}_{obs} = \\sigma_{\\varpi}/\\varpi\\). The shaded areas indicate the 2\\(\\sigma\\) credible interval about \\(1/r\\) and the corresponding transformed credible interval. As \\(f_{obs}\\) increases, the probability distribution for \\(r\\) becomes more skewed, such that stars with larger parallax uncertainties become more likely to have overestimated \\(r\\) than to have underestimated \\(r\\). From Astraatmadja and Bailer-Jones (2016a) This skewness must be taken into account in order to prevent systematic uncertainties being introduced into the Leavitt law calibration. Therefore, rather than use the simple parallax equation given in Eq. (5.8), we must use a full Bayesian analysis to estimate distances. A full discussion of the application of Bayesian statistics to parallax measurements is beyond the scope of this course. However, if you are interested in the methodology, the series of papers by Astraatmadja &amp; Bailer-Jones gives an excellent introduction to the topic (Bailer-Jones 2015; Astraatmadja and Bailer-Jones 2016a; Astraatmadja and Bailer-Jones 2016b).

Like all experiments, measurements from the distance ladder contain both systematic and random uncertainties (see Sec. 5.7). In order to determine whether our measurements of cosmological parameters are robust, we must use more than one technique to measure them. In this Chapter, we will look at standard rulers, and how the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) can be used to make independent and complementary measurements of the cosmological model. 6.1 Standard Candles vs Standard Rulers Standard rulers are similar to standard candles in that they have a known intrinsic property. Standard rulers are objects with known intrinsic physical size. By measuring the apparent (angular) size of an object and comparing to its actual physical size, we can calculate the distance of the object in question. Table 6.1 shows a comparison of the standard candle and standard ruler techniques. Table 6.1: Comparison of standard candles and standard rulers Standard Candles Standard Rulers Objects of known intrinsic luminosity Objects of known physical size Compare apparent and absolute brightness to determine distance Compare apparent to actual size to measure distance Build up ladder from nearest to furthest objects to estimate \\(H_0\\) “Reverse distance ladder” – measuring \\(H(z)\\) and extrapolating to \\(H_0\\) A key point to take away from Table 6.1 is the different methods used to estimate \\(H_0\\). The standard candle distance ladder builds up in the way you would expect – starting with the nearest objects as calibrators, gradually building up to more and more distant objects to eventually determine \\(H_0\\). Standard rulers, however, use a reverse distance ladder which does not directly measure \\(H_0\\). Instead, measurements are made of \\(H(z)\\) (the Hubble parameter at redshift \\(z\\)), and a cosmological model is used to infer the value of \\(H_0\\). The great strength of this approach is that it is independent of the measurements that have gone into the distance ladder. The results of the standard candle experiments can provide independent verification of the results from standard ruler experiments. The main drawback, however, is that measurements of e.g. \\(H_0\\) are dependent on the cosmological model used. We will review the strengths and limitations of the different techniques in a later section. The most well-known standard ruler in astronomy is perhaps the Cosmic Microwave Background. In this Chapter we will investigate the formation of the CMB, and how we can derive cosmological parameters from CMB measurements. 6.2 What is the Cosmic Microwave Background The Cosmic Microwave Background can be thought of as the radiation “left over” from the Big Bang. First detected by Penzias and Wilson in 1965, the CMB is seen over the whole sky has a black-body spectra that peaks at \\(T\\) = 2.726 K. Figure 6.1 shows the Cosmic Microwave Background observed by the Planck satellite. Although you can see fluctuation in Fig. 6.1, these variations are very small. The CMB is incredibly flat with temperature variations of the order of around \\(\\frac{\\Delta T}{T} = 10^{-5}\\). To put this into perspective, if the water in a regular swimming pool was as flat as the CMB, the ripples on the surface would be less than 10 \\(\\mu\\)m high! Figure 6.1: The Cosmic Microwave Background observed by Planck. Credit: Planck Legacy Release 2018, ESA and the Planck collaboration. 6.3 How did the CMB form? :::fyi The images in the section come from the excellent review article ‘The Cosmic Symphony’ by Wayne Hu and Martin White. The notes for this chapter should be used alongside the Hu and White (2004) article, and Wayne Hu’s beginner and intermediate CMB tutorials. ::: Figure 6.2: The formation of the CMB. From Hu and White (2004). Very early on in the Universe’s evolution, the matter and radiation were coupled (region A on Fig. 6.2). The protons, electrons, and photons behaved as a single plasma, with photons scattered by the electrons. At this time any small fluctuations in the density of the plasma propagated through it like sound waves. Like any other plasma, compression resulted in heating, and rarefaction resulted in cooling of the plasma. Approximately 370,000 years after the Big Bang (region B on Fig. 6.2) the Universe had expanded (hence cooled) sufficiently that the protons could capture the electrons to form neutral Hydrogen. This process is known as recombination. As the photons were no longer scattering off free electrons, they were able to travel throughout the Universe. Photons that originated from the hotter, denser regions had higher energy, while those from the cooler, less dense regions had lower energies. This pattern of hot and cold fluctuations was then frozen into the CMB. It was not only the CMB photons that these density variations affected. As the Universe expands and cools further, gravitational attraction causes matter to condense in the denser regions of the Universe. This leads to the formation of the first stars and galaxies (region C on Fig. 6.2). 6.4 Where do the fluctuations come from? In Sec. 6.3 we saw that there are fluctuations in the “plasma” of protons, electrons, and photons that permeates the early Universe. But where do these fluctuations come from? The Cosmological principle tells us that the Universe should be homogeneous and isotropic, so why is this plasma not completely flat? The answer comes from one of the strangest stages of the Universe’s evolution – inflation (region D on Fig. 6.2). We believe that in the very early Universe (\\(t &lt; 10^{-32}~s)\\) since the Big Bang) that the Universe was permeated by an “inflation field” that caused it to expand faster than the speed of light, \\(c\\). During the inflationary period, there were quantum fluctuations in the field which caused the variations in density seen later on. These quantum fluctuations were extremely small at the time (as quantum fluctuations tend to be…), but they were amplified by the rapid expansion of the Universe. This all sounds quite far-fetched (even for Cosmologists), but there is observational evidence that inflation occurred in the very early Universe. Firstly, we observe that these fluctuations are approximately equal on all scales, adding weight to the quantum fluctuations explanation. Secondly, we see that the “sound waves” frozen into the CMB are all in phase with each other. This tells us that they must have all been created at the same time. We will return to mysteries and evidence for inflation in a later section of the course. For now, the key point to take away is that the density variations in the early Universe were caused by quantum fluctuations in the inflationary field that were amplified by the rapid expansion. 6.5 Analysing the CMB To get at the tasty cosmological parameters hidden in maps of the CMB like the one in Fig. 6.1 we have to transform the images into something more useful. The main tool in CMB analysis is the power spectrum. Figure 6.3 (adapted from Planck Collaboration (2018)) is the angular power spectrum of the CMB from the Planck mission. Figure 6.3: The angular power spectrum of the CMB. The first peak corresponds to the fundamental frequency, with the lower amplitude peaks corresponding to overtone frequencies. Adapted from Planck Collaboration (2018). The power spectrum shown in Figure 6.3 has several peaks, each corresponding to a different mode of the waves in the CMB. The relative positions and amplitudes of these peaks can tell us about the physical processes and conditions in the early Universe. Before we look at what exactly the power spectrum tells us, we’ll look in more detail at what’s actually going on in these “waves”. Continuing our analogy of thinking of the density fluctuations as sound waves, we can relate how a sound wave propagates through a pipe to what’s happening in the Universe. Figure 6.4 shows us how the air is compressed and rarefied as a sound wave moves through an open pipe. Figure 6.4: The propagation of a sound wave through an open pipe. Blue regions correspond to regions where the air is compressed, red regions correspond to regions where it is rarefied. From Hu and White (2004). The top pipe in Fig. 6.4 shows the fundamental mode of the wave. There is maximum compression of the air at the end that you blow in to, and minimum compression (maximum rarefaction) at the other end. For the overtone frequencies there are multiple regions of maximum and minimum compression, with the number of each dependent on the wave’s mode. For example, if the wave was oscillating in the first overtone frequency, there would be two regions of maximum compression, and one of minimum compression. For a second overtone wave, there are two of each. Figure 6.5 demonstrates the same effect in the plasma in the early Universe. Regions were compressed (blue) and rarefied (red). This compression and rarefaction resulted in temperature changes in the CMB photons, so that at the time of recombination photons that originated from the compressed regions had higher temperatures (hence energies) than those originating from the less dense regions. Figure 6.5: Oscillations in the early Universe plasma. Blue regions are denser and have higher temperatures, resulting in higher energy photons than those in the less dense red regions. From Hu and White (2004). We can see now where the variations in the CMB and the peaks in the power spectrum originate from. However, you may be asking yourself an important question at this point. In Sec. 6.4 we said that the fluctuations are approximately equal on all scales. So why aren’t all the peaks in Fig. 6.1 the same height? The answer to this comes again from the nature of sound waves. A sound wave of a given wavelength can only propagate if it travels over a distance that is longer than it’s wavelength. This means that any fluctuations with wavelengths smaller than the distance travelled will dissipate. The density of the plasma in the early Universe was such that a particle could typically travel around 3 kpc before it interacted with something else, and waves shorter than about 10 times this length (i.e. 30 kpc) would be damped. Since the epoch of recombination, the Universe has expanded by a factor of approximately 1000, meaning that any waves on a scale below 30 Mpc in today’s Universe would be damped. ::: fyi Wavelengths and wavelengths In the discussion above, the “wavelengths” referred to are the density waves in the plasma. This is not the same as the wavelength of the CMB photons. The CMB photons have microwave wavelengths, not Mpc scale wavelengths. ::: 6.6 Interpreting the power spectrum Now we understand the origin of the CMB fluctuations, we can investigate how changes to the cosmological parameters will be reflected by changes in the power spectrum. Figure 6.6 shows the physical processes behind the first peak in the power spectrum. Figure 6.6: The first peak of the CMB power spectrum. The left hand figure shows the distributions of dark matter and temperature at the end of inflation. The right hand figure shows the dark matter and temperature distributions at the epoch of recombination. From Hu and White (2004). On the left hand side of Fig. 6.6 we see the distribution of dark matter, baryons, and the CMB temperature at the end of the inflationary period. As dark matter only interacts via gravity, it concentrates into the potential energy troughs (the dips in 6.6) on the same scale as the fundamental wave in the plasma. These concentrations of dark matter increase the depth of the potential well, attracting baryons and photons in there with them. As the photons would now lose more energy escaping these deeper potential wells, known as the Sachs-Wolfe effect, these regions correspond to colder photons. The right hand side of Fig. 6.6 shows the distributions of baryons and temperature at the time of recombination. By this point, gravity (which acts on both the baryons and the dark matter) and the sonic motion of the waves (which acts only on the baryons) have worked together to increase the temperature of the photons in the potential energy troughs and lower the temperature in the peaks. Matter is still condensed in the potential energy troughs, but these regions now correspond to hot regions in the CMB. Figure 6.7: The second peak of the CMB power spectrum. For the second (and higher order) peaks, the effects of gravity and sonic motion can counteract each other. The top left figure shows that the forces act in a similar way to the fundamental peak initially. However, the top right figure shows us that, well before the epoch of recombination, the increase in temperature in the potential energy troughs results in an increase in radiation pressure. This pushes photons out of the potential well, while baryons are still being drawn in. By recombination, these forces have decreased the amplitude of the potential, resulting in a smoother potential energy (and hence temperature) distribution. From Hu and White (2004). Figure 6.7 shows the forces affecting the second peak of the CMB power spectrum. For the second (and higher order) peaks, the effects of gravity and sonic motion can counteract each other. The top left figure shows that the forces act in a similar way to the fundamental peak initially. However, the top right figure shows us that, well before the epoch of recombination, the increase in temperature in the potential energy troughs results in an increase in radiation pressure. This pushes photons out of the potential well, while baryons are still being drawn in. By recombination, these forces have decreased the amplitude of the potential, resulting in a smoother potential energy (and hence temperature) distribution. The result is that the temperature differences are smaller in the second (and higher) order peaks of the CMB power spectrum. As discussed in Section 6.1, estimates of parameters such as \\(H_0\\) from the CMB depend on the cosmological model we assume. We can derive some cosmological parameters by analysing the power spectrum as we understand how they affect the locations and heights of the peaks. :::fyi This is a good time to take a look at Wayne Hu’s intermediate CMB tutorial. The animations showing how changing cosmological parameters affect the observed power spectrum are really useful. ::: The position of the first peak of the power spectrum (Fig. 6.3) is influenced by the curvature of the Universe, \\(k\\). As \\(k\\) decreases, the first peak in Fig. 6.3 moves to the right. We know from Sec. 2.1 that changing \\(k\\) changes the Robertson-Walker metric. Two objects in a Universe with \\(k = 0\\) will have a different physical separation \\(ds\\) (hence be subject to a different gravitational force) than two objects with the same \\((r, \\theta, \\phi)\\) coordinates in a \\(k=1\\) Universe. This is why the position of the first peak moves as we change \\(k\\). The relative heights of the odd and even peaks in the power spectrum are affected by a process called baryon loading. Increasing the fraction of baryons in the Universe (i.e. increasing $_{b}) increases the heights of the odd peaks relative to the heights of the even peaks. Another important effect is radiation driving. If the radiation energy density dominates over the matter energy density, then the baryon-photon plasma will not be oscillating in a fixed potential well. The potential decays, driving up the amplitudes of the peaks in the power spectrum. We can estimate cosmological parameters by taking all these effects, and multiple peaks, into account. For example, if the dark matter density (\\(\\Omega_{dm}\\)) is increased, the radiation driving effect is reduced. Conversely, if \\(\\Omega_{dm}\\) is decreased, the effects of baryon loading are reduced. These effects will change all the peaks in the power spectrum. By considering (at least) the first three peaks, we can disentangle the different effects and break degeneracies between the effects of baryonic and dark matter. 6.7 Planck results Figure 6.3 shows the Planck power spectrum. Now we understand how to interpret it, we can look at the results that came out of the Planck mission. Figure 6.8 shows a selection of the cosmological parameters derived in Planck Collaboration (2018) and their relationship to each other. Table 6.2 shows the best fit values for the Planck Collaboration (2018) cosmological parameters. Figure 6.8: Results from Planck Collaboration (2018). The different coloured ellipses represent different analyses of the data. Grey, red, and blue represent the results using only Planck data, with green ellipses combining the Planck data with results from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) experiments.

In an upcoming session, we will compare results from different (complementary) experiments to assess just how much we really understand about the cosmological model. The key point to take away from this subsection is that there are interdependencies and degeneracies between the parameters, and that one experiment cannot give us all the answers. References "],

Observations the cosmic microwave background (CMB, Ch. 6, and those taken in distance ladder experiments (Ch. 5) can tell us things about the Universe such as: that it is expanding, its geometrical properties, its age, its composition, how it started, and how it ultimately may end. We can combine this knowledge into a cosmological model. The standard cosmological model is known as \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM. Two of the key features of this model are given in it’s name: It assumes that the Universe has a component of its energy density driven by the cosmological constant, \\(\\Lambda\\), and that dark matter is cold dark matter (CDM). The cosmological constant term is believed to be due to dark energy. Cold dark matter refers to dark matter particles that have non-relativistic velocities. 7.2 What evidence do we have? The features of the \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM model are supported by observational evidence (as is the case with all good physical models!). We will now look at the evidence that supports several of the key features of \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM. 7.2.1 Expansion of the Universe \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM assumes that the Universe is expanding. The evidence supporting this is possibly one of the earliest to be confirmed, with Hubble’s first measurements in the 1920s, and increasingly precise measurements of the rate of expansion in the following century. The top panel of Figure 7.1 is the Hubble diagram from Riess et al. (1998), showing the distance modulus as a function of redshift for a sample of supernova host galaxies (see Sec. 5.2 and Eq. (5.4) for the relation between distance modulus and distance). The more distant objects in the sample are moving away from us faster than the closer objects, showing that the Universe is expanding. Figure 7.1: Top panel: Hubble diagram showing distance as a function of redshift for a sample of supernova host galaxies. Bottom panel: Here \\(\\Delta(m-M)\\) represents the difference in distance modulus from a model assuming no dark energy contribution \\((\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.00)\\). The model that best fits the observed data has \\(\\Omega_m = 0.20\\) and \\(\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.80\\), showing a significant dark energy contribution. From Riess et al. (1998). 7.2.2 Geometry of the Universe Theory suggest that we live in a ‘flat’ Universe. Observations from the CMB provide strong evidence that the Universe is flat. However, they do not prove that the Universe is precisely flat, i.e. \\(k=0\\).. The observational evidence we do have shows that \\(k\\) must be very, very, very close to zero, but we cannot prove that \\(k \\equiv 0\\). We will revisit the flatness problem at a later point, but for now we will assume that \\(k=0\\). 7.2.3 Age of the Universe We can estimate the age of the Universe from different independent sources. Globular clusters are contain the oldest stars in the Universe. We can use our knowledge of stellar evolution to determine the ages of these stars to get a lower limit to the age of the Universe. Measurements of the CMB can also help us to estimate the Universe’s age. When we include \\(\\Lambda\\) in CMB modelling and analysis, we find an age of the Universe that is consistent with other estimates such as the age of globular clusters. However, this consistency is relatively new (cosmologically speaking…). In the 1980s (or thereabouts), the ages that were calculated for stars in globular clusters were much less robust and stellar evolution models produced stars that were older than the Universe itself! This is often referred to as the cosmological paradox. This was resolved by the Hipparcos satellite (Gaia’s predecessor), that provided better measurements of stars in the Milky way, which resulted in improvements in the population synthesis models for globular clusters, decreasing their ages. Similarly, including \\(\\Lambda\\) in cosmological models reduced the discrepancy. Including \\(\\Lambda\\) in the Universe’s energy density increased the age of the Universe. As $increased the age of the Universe and the estimated ages of globular clusters were reduced, the oldest stars were now younger than the the age of the Universe. The cosmological paradox was solved, and the stellar modellers could sleep soundly once again. This shows why we need independent measurements of cosmological parameters to truly believe our results. 7.2.4 Composition of the Universe As we saw in Ch. 6, observations of the CMB can provide important information about the composition of the Universe, such as the density of dark matter. Some of the earliest evidence for dark matter came from galaxy rotation curves. Observations of galaxy rotation curves made by Vera Rubin showed that there must be ‘missing’ making the outskirts of galaxies rotate faster than predicted by their visible matter alone. Table 7.1 summarises our current understanding of the Universe’s composition. Table 7.1: Fractional contributions of each component to the Universe’s energy density. Component Evidence Value Radiation CMB temperature \\(\\Omega_{rad} = 2.47 \\times 10^{-5}\\) Relativistic particles and photons Cosmic neutrino background (theory) \\(\\Omega_{rel} = 4 \\times 10^{-5}\\) Baryons Nucleosynthesis predictions and CMB \\(\\Omega_{b} = 0.05\\) Cold dark matter CMB measurements \\(\\Omega_{b} = 0.27\\) Cosmological constant Acceleration \\(\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.68\\) 7.2.5 Early history of the Universe It is impossible for us to study the initial conditions of the Universe. The earliest time that it would be physically possible make measurements of is approximately \\(10^{-43}\\) seconds after the big bang. This is known as the Planck time. At scales below the Planck time, the effects of quantum gravity are likely to be important. In Sec. @ref(sec:first_second) we looked at what happened in the first second of the Universe’s evolution. Around \\(10^{-32}\\) seconds after the big bang, we believe that the Universe underwent a period of inflation. The observational evidence for inflation comes (somewhat indirectly) from the CMB. The sizes of the fluctuations in the CMB and of features in the large scale structure of the Universe (e.g. clusters of galaxies) agree with the predictions from the theory of inflation. So while we cannot directly observe the inflationary period, we can see the evidence it left behind. 7.2.6 Fate of the Universe In Sections 3.5 and 4.7 we saw that a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant will expand forever. We have observational evidence that this is currently the case. Figure. 7.2 (the same as the bottom panel in Fig 7.1 shows how different cosmological models fit to observations of supernovae. Figure 7.2: Here \\(\\Delta(m-M)\\) represents the difference in distance modulus from a model assuming no dark energy contribution \\((\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.00)\\). The model that best fits the observed data has \\(\\Omega_m = 0.20\\) and \\(\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.80\\), showing a significant dark energy contribution. Adapted from Riess et al. (1998). The data from Riess et al. (1998) (and many subsequent experiments) show that the model that best fits the data is one where there is a significant contribution from a cosmological constant. Assuming that \\(\\Lambda\\) continues to dominate the energy density, the Universe should expand forever and an increasingly fast rate. However, these experiments do not rule out any unknown unknowns. In the same way that we didn’t know that dark energy was the dominant term 25 years ago, it may be that something else that we haven’t predicted that dominates the energy density in the future. 7.3 Assumptions and Interpretation We can combine the evidence from all our experiments, e.g. Planck CMB observations, supernova experiments, etc., to build our cosmological model. Table 7.2 gives a selection of the key parameters in the base \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM model from Planck Collaboration (2018). We’ve come across several of these before, such as the energy densities, \\(\\Omega\\), and the Hubble constant \\(H_0\\). There are a couple of new ones here though. Table 7.2: Base \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM cosmological parameters from Planck Collaboration (2018). Parameter Best fit value Uncertainty \\(\\Omega_{b}h^2\\) 0.02233 0.00015 \\(\\Omega_{c}h^2\\) 0.1198 0.0012 \\(\\Omega_{m}h^2\\) 0.1428 0.0011 \\(H_0\\) 67.37 0.54 \\(\\Omega_{m}\\) 0.3147 0.0074 Age (Gyr) 13.801 0.024 \\(z_{re}\\) 7.64 0.74 100\\(\\theta_{*}\\) 1.04108 0.00031 \\(z_{re}\\) is the redshift at the time of recombination. \\(\\theta_{*}\\) is the acoustic scale, defined as \\[\\begin{equation} \\theta_{*} = \\dfrac{r_{*}}{D_m} \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(r_{*}\\) is the sound horizon at the time of recombination, and \\(D_m\\) is the comoving angular diameter distance, given by \\[\\begin{equation} D_m = \\dfrac{a_0 r_0}{(1+z)} \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] The nature of these analyses is that many parameters are dependent on the others. Of the parameters in Table 7.2, only the first two, \\(\\Omega_{b}h^2\\) and \\(\\Omega_{c}h^2\\), are modelled directly. The other parameters are all dependent on these (plus some additional parameters that I haven’t included – if you’re interested you can take a look at Table 1 in Planck Collaboration (2018)). The implication of this is that the value of, say, \\(H_0\\) that comes out of this analysis depends on the other parameters and any assumptions that are included. Two key assumptions that go into the \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM model are that the Universe is flat, and that the dark energy equation of state parameter w=-1. It is possible to allow \\(k\\) and \\(w\\) to be free parameters in the cosmological model (known as an extended model). The results and implications of this will be covered in a later session.

Each experiment uses a different technique that is independent and complementary to the others. We will not be going into the technical details of each experiment here, but you are welcome to look at the original papers if you wish to learn more. Under normal circumstances this part of the course would have been a discussion session, with each of you reading one of the three papers and discussing it in a group. As the format has been changed, you are not expected to read the papers, but you are expected to understand the main points that are summarised in this chapter. 8.1 How to read a scientific paper When reading any scientific paper, there are several key questions you should keep in mind. What is the technique being used in this paper? How does it work? How does the technique relate to other techniques you know about? What is the main result of the paper? What are the possible uncertainties in the experiment? How well are they understood? Which parameters are constrained by the experiment, and which are assumed? What (if any) improvements are suggested to better constrain their results? These are the same questions you should be able to answer for each of the experiments in this section. I’ve done some of the hard work for you here by summarising the key results, but you’ll get the most out of this section if you make your own comparisons between them and try to come to your own conclusions. 8.2 Experiment A: The standard candle experiment Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheid Standards Provide a 1% Foundation for the Determination of the Hubble Constant and Stronger Evidence for Physics Beyond \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM, Riess et al. (2019) https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ…876…85R/abstract Click here for paper pdf In this experiment, Riess et al. (2019) use Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (our nearest galaxy) to improve their measurement of \\(H_0\\). The use the distance ladder technique (Sec. 5.5), fixing the base of the ladder using precise measurements of Cepheids using the Hubble Space Telescope. Combining their Cepheid measurements with an independent measurement of the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud from eclipsing binaries, they estimate \\(H_0 = 74.03 \\pm 1.42\\) km s\\(^{-1}\\) Mpc\\(^{-1}\\). There are two key results in this paper. Firstly, they are able to reduce the uncertainty on their \\(H_0\\) measurement to just under 2%. Note that the 1% quoted in the title of the paper is not the uncertainty on \\(H_0\\), but is the uncertainty on the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. This work was the first distance ladder experiment to measure \\(H_0\\) to better than 2%. The second key result comes from comparing their result to the Planck experiment. Planck Collaboration (2018) found a significantly lower value for \\(H_0\\) than had been measured in distance ladder experiments. However, the uncertainties on the distance ladder experiments were large compared to the Planck uncertainties. This meant that, although the difference in the results was interesting, it wasn’t significant as the results differed by less than 3\\(\\sigma\\) (3 standard deviations). By measuring \\(H_0\\) more precisely, Riess et al. (2019) showed that the difference between the standard candle and standard ruler experiments was significant, with \\(\\Delta H_0 = 4.4\\sigma\\). Figure 8.1 shows Riess’s result (red point, labelled “Here”) compared to other standard candle results (other red points) and standard ruler results (blue points) Figure 8.1: The 4.4\\(\\sigma\\) difference between local measurements of \\(H_0\\) and the value predicted from Planck+\\(\\Lambda\\)CDM. Possible physics causes for a 2%–4% change in \\(H_0\\) include time-dependent dark energy or nonzero curvature, while a larger 5%– 8% difference may come from dark matter interaction, early dark energy or additional relativistic particles.
