# Unit Overview {-}
  The aim of this section of PH40112 is to present the observations and
  theory underpinning modern Cosmology. It is complementary to the first
  half of PH40112, which focusses on General Relativity and its
  applications to Cosmology. At the end of this course, you should be
  able to describe the key ideas of Cosmology, comparing and contrasting
  different observational techniques and Cosmological models. You should
  understand the implications for the fate of the Universe arising from
  these different models, and discuss the open questions being addressed
  by current state of the art experiments. You should also be able to
  assess how systematic errors and experimental uncertainties affect
  cosmological experiments, in particular how these affect our ability
  to discriminate between different models of the Universe's evolution.

  The following content will be addressed in the context of Relativistic
  Cosmology:

  -   Cosmological dynamics

  -   The Cosmological constant

  -   The expanding Universe and the big bang

  -   The accelerating expansion of the Universe

  -   Inflation

  -   The early Universe and the formation of structure

  -   The standard Cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM)

  This section of the course closely follows several chapters of *An
  Introduction to Modern Cosmology: 3$^{\text{rd}}$ edition* by Liddle.
  You may find it helpful to refer to this book or others such as *The
  Oxford companion to Cosmology* by Liddle and Loveday, which is
  available in the University library.

  In addition to these notes, we will be discussing journal publications
  from *The Astrophysical Journal* and *Astronomy & Astrophysics*. These
  are available online through the library and will be placed on Moodle
  in advance of the relevant sessions.
