It is complementary to the first half of PH40112, which focusses on General Relativity and its applications to Cosmology. At the end of this course, you should be able to describe the key ideas of Cosmology, comparing and contrasting different observational techniques and Cosmological models. You should understand the implications for the fate of the Universe arising from these different models, and discuss the open questions being addressed by current state of the art experiments. You should also be able to assess how systematic errors and experimental uncertainties affect cosmological experiments, in particular how these affect our ability to discriminate between different models of the Universe’s evolution. The following content will be addressed in the context of Relativistic Cosmology: Cosmological dynamics The Cosmological constant The expanding Universe and the big bang The accelerating expansion of the Universe Inflation The early Universe and the formation of structure The standard Cosmological model (\\(\\Lambda\\)CDM) This section of the course closely follows several chapters of An Introduction to Modern Cosmology: 3\\(^{\\text{rd}}\\) edition by Liddle. You may find it helpful to refer to this book or others such as The Oxford companion to Cosmology by Liddle and Loveday, which is available in the University library. In addition to these notes, we will be discussing journal publications from The Astrophysical Journal and Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics. These are available online through the library and will be placed on Moodle in advance of the relevant sessions. "],
["ch-intro-obs.html", "Chapter 2 Overview of Observational Cosmology 2.1 A brief history of the Universe 2.2 The Cosmological Principle 2.3 The Expanding Universe", " Chapter 2 Overview of Observational Cosmology This part introduces the observational foundation of Cosmology. It builds upon the material in PH30111: Introduction to Galaxies and Cosmology. Some material may be familiar to you, but the origins and derivations of the equations will be discussed in more depth, and will include the relativistic treatment introduced in the first half of this course. 2.1 A brief history of the Universe The ‘Cosmic Calendar’ shown in Figure 2.1 condenses the evolution of the Universe to a timescale of 1 calendar year. If the Big Bang occurred on January 1st, human life wouldn’t exist until 11:52pm on 31st December! The formation of the Solar System would have occurred in September, and our home in the Galaxy, the disk of the Milky Way, would have formed in May. As Figure 2.1 shows, our understanding of how the Universe and our place in it has evolved over time uses different sources of evidence depending on the time frame. Our knowledge of recent history comes from written records, while our knowledge of the formation of the Solar System and the evolution of Earth comes from geology. However, to understand how the Universe as a whole came to be, we must look further back in time. Figure 2.1: The Cosmic Calendar.

This section gives a brief history of the evolution; topics will be covered in further detail later in the course. We will not move through these chronologically in this course; instead this is intended to give you an overview of how the different ideas we cover come together. Figure 2.2: Evolution of the Universe. Original image credit: NASA/WMAP Science Team 2.1.1 The first second The first second after the Big Bang was quite dramatic. Highlights of this time are given below. Bear in mind that all of the following happens in less time than it takes for your heart to beat twice. The Big Bang \\((t = 0)\\) The Universe began with the Big Bang, rapidly expanding from an initial singularity. Planck epoch \\((t = 10^{-43}~s)\\) The Planck epoch refers to the stage when the Universe’s density exceeded a critical density, such that the energy scale is greater than the Planck scale. At this scale, quantum effects are important even for gravitational physics. Separation of forces \\((10^{-43}~s &lt; t &lt; 10^{-36}~s)\\) After the Planck epoch, other fundamental forces start to separate out. First, the gravitational force and electronuclear force decouple, then the electronuclear force separates out into the strong and electroweak forces. Inflation \\((t &lt; 10^{-32}~s)\\) Early in its evolution, the Universe underwent a period of rapid inflation, expanding by a factor of \\(10^{78}\\) (or \\(10^{26}\\) in each of the three spatial dimensions). Under this rapid expansion, an area of space of the order of 1 nm\\(^{3}\\) would expand to approximately 30 pc\\(^{3}\\) (equivalent to around 100 lyr\\(^{3})\\). Such expansion must occur at greater than the speed of light (\\(c\\)). However, as it is the metric of space time that is expanding, the limitation of exceeding \\(c\\) is not applicable, and inflation can occur. Electroweak symmetry breaking \\((t = 10^{-12}~s)\\) After inflation, the electroweak force separates into the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces. Quark epoch \\((t = 10^{-12}~s)\\) At the same time as electroweak symmetry breaking, the energy density of the Universe has decreased such that matter can exist in the form of quarks. Baryogenesis \\((t = 10^{-11}~s)\\) Baryogenesis is the stage where matter can start to exist in the form of baryons - e.g. protons, neutrons. Baryogensis should have produced both baryons and anti-baryons (e.g. protons and anti-protons). Current evidence - i.e. the fact that we exist and are composed of baryons - shows that there must have been an asymmetry in the proportions of baryons/anti-baryons, otherwise they would have all have annihilated. The Baryogenesis process and baryon asymmetry are current areas of research. Hadron epoch \\((10^{-6}~s &lt; t &lt; 1~s)\\) The Hadron epoch occurred when the Universe had cooled far enough for hadrons to exist and dominate the energy density. The proportions of hadrons and anti-hadrons were similar, such that they were in thermal equilibrium and mostly annihilated, producing photons, although a small number of hadrons remained. Neutrino decoupling \\((t &lt; 1~s)\\) Around 1s after the Big Bang, neutrinos decoupled and were free to propagate through the Universe. Neutrinos have a very small interaction cross section, so the Cosmic Neutrino Background created at neutrino decoupling should still exist today. However, as the neutrinos produced at decoupling have such low energies, it is impossible to detect them with current experiments. Lepton epoch \\((1~s &lt; t &lt; 10~s)\\) Similar to the Hadron epoch, the Lepton epoch produced both leptons and anti-leptons (e.g, electrons, muons, neutrinos etc.) These would have annihilated, producing pairs of photons. A small number of leptons remain after annihilation. 2.1.2 After the first second: The Universe has now been evolving for around 1 s. It has exponentially expanded, created all the matter and radiation we see (and destroyed a whole load too), and gone through several rounds of fundamental physical forces. What else is left to do for the next 13.77 billion years? Photon epoch \\((10~s &lt; t &lt; 377,000\\text{ years})\\) After baryons, hadrons and leptons have mostly been annihilated, the majority of the Universe’s energy is dominated by photons. Light Element Nucleosynthesis \\((2 \\text{ mins} &lt; t &lt; 20\\text{ mins})\\) Nucleosynthesis is the stage where light elements (i.e., Hydrogen, Deuterium, Helium, Lithium) were formed. Elements heavier than Helium were very difficult to form due to the large amounts of energy/time required. Matter domination \\((t = 47,000\\text{ years})\\) Around 47,000 years after the Big Bang, the energy density of matter in the Universe overtakes that of radiation. Matter now becomes the dominant driver of the Universe’s evolution. Epoch of recombination and photon decoupling \\((t = 377,000\\text{ years})\\) During the epoch of recombination, ionised particles (e.g. electrons, protons) combined to form neutral atoms. At this stage, the matter density was such that photons only had a short path length before they would interact with an ionised particle, making the Universe opaque. As recombination progressed, and ionised particles combined into neutral atoms, the photon path length increased, making the Universe transparent to photons. The decoupled photons produced during this time have been redshifted by the expansion of the Universe, so we now observe them as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Dark Ages \\((380,000 \\text{ years}&lt; t &lt; 1\\text{ Gyr})\\) At this time, photons were free to stream through the Universe. However, light-producing systems such as stars had not yet formed, so the Universe was &quot;dark&quot;. The only sources of photons were those from the CMB, and those emitted from neutral Hydrogen atoms at 21 cm. Formation of structure \\((150\\text{ Myr} &lt; t &lt; 1\\text{ Gyr})\\) Structure forms hierarchically in the Universe; smaller structures form first and are built up into larger ones. The first structures to form in the Universe were stars, dwarf galaxies, and quasars. The first population of stars (Population III stars) are thought to have formed around t \\(=700\\) Myr. Pop III stars are yet to be detected observationally. Epoch of reionisation \\((250 \\text{ Myr} &lt; t 1\\text{ Gyr})\\) Pop III stars introduced a new source of radiation into the Universe. During the epoch of reionisation this radiation ionised the neutral Hydrogen, creating a plasma of protons and electrons. The epoch of reionisation most likely lasted until around 1 Gyr, when the Population III stars died off. At this time, the ionised Hydrogen gradually recombined to neutral Hydrogen once more. Formation of Galaxies and Clusters \\((t\\)&gt;\\(1 \\text{ Gyr})\\) &quot;Large&quot; galaxies and galaxy clusters formed from around t = 1 Gyr. These would have first comprised Population II stars, which, unlike Pop III stars, we do observe today. Later, the next generation of stars, Pop I, formed. Dark Energy epoch \\((t &gt; 9.8 \\text{ Gyr})\\) We are currently believed to be in the dark energy epoch, where the energy density of the Universe is dominated by the dark energy contribution. While we don’t know the nature of dark energy, its effects are seen as driving the expansion of the Universe so it is not just getting larger, but the expansion itself is accelerating. 2.2 The Cosmological Principle The Cosmological Principle is the belief that our position in the Universe is not special in any way. If the Cosmological Principle holds, then there is no special position in the Universe, meaning that it should be the same everywhere (i.e. it should be homogeneous), and it should have no preferred direction (i.e. it should be isotropic) Clearly the Universe is not isotropic and homogeneous on small scales – the distributions of things like stars, planets and galaxies give more or less dense regions locally. But on a large scale, the Universe does display homogeneity and isotropy; Galaxy clusters are spread over the Universe and not concentrated to one side, and the CMB has only very tiny fluctuations. 2.3 The Expanding Universe The first observational evidence that the Universe is expanding was found by Edwin Hubble (Hubble 1929). By measuring the distances to nearby galaxies using the Cepheid Leavitt Law1, and comparing these distances to the galaxies’ redshifts. Hubble measured the expansion rate of the Universe (the Hubble constant, \\(\\mathbf{H_0}\\)) to be approximately 500 km s\\(^{-1}\\) Mpc\\(^{-1}\\). Hubble’s observations are shown in Figure 2.3. Throughout this course we will explore how observations of the Universe have developed over the past century, increasing in precision and accuracy, leading to our current understanding of Cosmology. Figure 2.3: The first observational evidence of the expanding Universe. His first measurement of the expansion rate, now known as the Hubble constant, was 500 km s\\(^{-1}\\) Mpc\\(^{-1}\\).

The distance between two points is given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta s^2 = \\Delta x_{1}^{2} + \\Delta x_{2}^{2} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Delta x_{1}^{2}\\) and \\(\\Delta x_{2}^{2}\\) are the separations in the \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) coordinates. What about if we replaced the paper with a rubber sheet that can expand? The coordinate system \\(x_1\\)–\\(x_2\\) will expand with the sheet, and the physical distance between the points will change over time. Assuming that the expansion is uniform over the whole sheet, we now have \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta s^2 = a^2(t)\\left[\\Delta x_{1}^{2} + \\Delta x_{2}^{2}\\right] \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(a(t)\\) measures the rate of expansion. \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are comoving coordinates. Our current definition of \\(\\Delta s\\) only depends on the spatial distance between the points. However, in general relativity, we have to consider 4-dimensional space time, which may be curved. In this case, the distance becomes \\[\\begin{equation} ds^2 = \\sum_{\\mu, \\nu} g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^{\\mu} dx^{\\nu} \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) is the metric and \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\nu\\) are indices taking the values 0, 1, 2, 3. \\(x^{0}\\) is the time coordinate and \\(x^{1}, x^{2}, x^{3}\\) are the spatial coordinates. The spatial component of Equation (3.3) can be simplified by applying the Cosmological Principle (see Sec. 2.2) - i.e. the Universe should not have any preferred locations. This means that the spatial component must have constant curvature at all positions. Changing to spherical polar coordinates, we now get \\[\\begin{equation} ds^2_3 = \\dfrac{dr^2}{1 - kr^2} + r^2\\left(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2\\right) \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(ds_3^2\\) considers only the spatial dimensions, and \\(k\\) is a constant which measures the curvature of space. Incorporating this into the space-time metric gives \\[\\begin{equation} ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a^2(t) \\left[\\dfrac{dr^2}{1 - kr^2} + r^2\\left(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2\\right)\\right] \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] Which is the Robertson-Walker metric. Here \\(a(t)\\) is the scale factor of the Universe - i.e. \\(a(t) = r/r_0\\), where \\(r_0\\) is \\(r\\) at time \\(t_0\\). 3.2 The Einstein Equations The Robertson-Walker metric evolves according to Einstein’s equation: \\[\\begin{equation} R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\dfrac{1}{2}g_{\\mu\\nu}R = \\dfrac{8\\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu} \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] where \\({T_{\\mu\\nu}}\\) is the energy-momentum tensor of matter present, \\({R_{\\mu\\nu}}\\) is the Ricci tensor, and \\({R}\\) is the Ricci scalar. The Ricci components give the curvature of space-time. The energy-momentum tensor is assumed to be symmetric, meaning that there are potentially 10 Einstein equations. If \\(T_{\\mu\\nu}\\) has additional symmetries, then the number of equations is reduced. 3.3 Fluid equation We consider that any possible components of the Universe (e.g. matter, radiation) can be described as perfect fluids. Perfect fluids have no viscosity or heat flow, and their equations of state can be described using only density, \\(\\rho\\) and pressure, \\(P\\). Perfect fluids have a well known relation between energy, \\(E\\), pressure, \\(P\\), and temperature, \\(T\\): \\[\\begin{equation} dE + PdV = TdS \\tag{3.7} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(dV\\) is the change in volume, and \\(dS\\) is the change in entropy. If we consider a sphere of radius \\(a\\), using \\[\\begin{equation} E = mc^2 \\tag{3.8} \\end{equation}\\] we can relate the total energy contained within the sphere to its density via \\[\\begin{equation} E = \\dfrac{4\\pi}{3}a^3\\rho c^2 \\tag{3.9} \\end{equation}\\] Assuming that the sphere is expanding adiabatically, i.e. there is no change in entropy (\\(dS = 0\\)), differentiating Equation (3.7) with respect to \\(t\\) gives \\[\\begin{equation} \\dot{\\rho} + 3\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\left(\\rho + \\dfrac{P}{c^2}\\right) = 0 \\tag{3.10} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\dot{x} = \\dfrac{dx}{dt}, \\ddot{x} = \\dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2}\\), etc. As the energy of the perfect fluid depends only on \\(P\\) and \\(\\rho\\), the energy-momentum tensor for a perfect fluid is therefore \\[\\begin{equation} T_{\\mu\\nu} = \\text{diag}\\left(-\\rho c^2, P, P, P\\right) \\tag{3.11} \\end{equation}\\] This results in two independent Einstein equations, the time-time solution and the space-space solution. 3.3.1 Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar Deriving the full Ricci tensor is beyond the scope of this course. The following is provided for completeness. The components of the Ricci tensor that are not equal to zero are those where \\(\\mu = \\nu\\), such that \\(R_{tt} = -3\\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a}\\) \\(R_{rr} = \\dfrac{a\\ddot{a}}{1 - kr^2} + \\dfrac{2\\dot{a}^2}{1 - kr^2} + \\dfrac{2k}{1-kr^2}\\) \\(R_{\\theta\\theta} = r^2a\\ddot{a} + 2r^2\\dot{a}^2 + 2kr^2\\) \\(R_{\\phi\\phi} = r^2 a\\ddot{a}\\sin^2\\theta + 2r^2\\dot{a}^2\\sin^2\\theta + 2kr^2 \\sin^2\\theta\\) which simplifies to a diagonal tensor with \\[R_{tt}= -3\\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a}\\] and \\[R_{ii} = \\dfrac{-g_{ii}}{a^2}\\left(a\\ddot{a} + 2\\dot{a}^2 + 2k\\right)\\] The Ricci scalar becomes \\[R = g_{ik}R_{ik} = - 6\\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a} - 6\\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 - 6\\dfrac{k}{a^2}\\] 3.4 Friedman Equation Using the time-time solution of the Einstein equation gives \\[\\label{eqn:friedman} \\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 + \\dfrac{kc^2}{a^2} = \\dfrac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho\\]which is the Friedman equation. The space-space solution follows in a similar way: \\[2\\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a} + \\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 + \\dfrac{kc^2}{a^2} = -8\\pi G \\dfrac{P}{c^2}\\] Which looks odd right now, but by subtracting the Friedman equation (Eqn. \\[eqn:friedman\\]) we find: \\[\\label{eqn:acceleration} \\dfrac{\\ddot{a}}{a} = -\\dfrac{4\\pi G}{3}\\left(\\rho + \\dfrac{3P}{c^2}\\right)\\] which is the known as the acceleration equation. 3.4.1 Natural units a.k.a. where have all the \\(c^2\\)’s gone? From this point forward, you will see that the factor \\(\\left(k c^2/a^2\\right)\\) in the Friedman equation will magically become \\(\\left(k/a^2\\right)\\). This is because we often like to use natural units in Cosmology. Mass density \\(\\left(\\rho\\right)\\) and energy density \\(\\left(\\epsilon\\right)\\) are often used interchangeably in Cosmology, and are related by \\(\\epsilon = \\rho c^2\\). By converting to natural units, i.e. setting \\(c=1\\), mass density and energy density are equivalent. As you will see later, many important cosmological parameters are expressed in dimensionless units (e.g. the density parameter, see Section \\[sec:density\\_param\\]). So don’t worry about our missing \\(c^2\\) factor, it’s just another maths trick. 3.5 An alternative derivation of the Friedman equation The evolution of the scale factor, \\(a\\), can be derived using mostly Newtonian mechanics, in addition to two results from General Relativity: Birkhoff’s theorem – for a spherically symmetric system, the force due to gravity at radius \\(r\\) is determined only by the mass interior to \\(r\\). Energy contributes to the gravitating mass density, such that \\(E = \\rho_m + \\dfrac{u}{c^2}\\), where \\(\\rho_m\\) is the density of matter, and \\(u\\) is the energy density of radiation and relativistic particles. Consider a test particle on the surface of an expanding sphere of radius \\(r\\). From \\(F= m \\ddot{r}\\), its equation of motion can be shown to be \\[\\label{eqn:motion} \\ddot{r} = -\\dfrac{4\\pi}{3} G \\rho r\\] Density is proportional to \\(r^{-3}\\), so by defining \\(r_{0} = 1\\), we find \\[\\rho = \\rho_{0}r^{-3}\\] Which can be substituted into Eqn. \\[eqn:motion\\] to give: \\[\\label{eqn:ddot_r_1} \\ddot{r} = -\\dfrac{4\\pi}{3}\\dfrac{G\\rho_0}{r^2}\\] If \\(\\rho_0\\) is non-zero, then \\(\\ddot{r}\\) must also be non-zero. The Universe must either be expanding or contracting. To get Eqn. \\[eqn:ddot\\_r\\_1\\] into a useful form, we use some clever maths magic. First, multiply both sides by \\(\\dot{r}\\) to get: \\[\\dot{r}\\ddot{r} + \\dfrac{4\\pi}{3}\\dfrac{G\\rho_{0}}{r^2}\\dot{r} = 0\\] We can use our mad differentiation skills to recognise that \\[\\dfrac{d(\\dot{r}^2)}{dt} = 2\\dot{r}\\ddot{r}\\] Which leads to \\[\\dfrac{1}{2}\\dfrac{d(\\dot{r}^2)}{dt} + \\dfrac{4\\pi G \\rho_0}{3} \\dfrac{1}{r^2}\\dfrac{dr}{dt} = 0\\] Once again, we can use our handy \\(1^{st}\\) year maths skills to remind ourselves that \\[\\dfrac{1}{r^2}\\dfrac{dr}{dt} = -\\dfrac{d(1/r)}{dt}\\] so we can simplify it further to \\[\\label{ddot_r_2} \\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left[\\dot{r}^2 - \\dfrac{(8\\pi G \\rho_0 / 3)}{r}\\right] = 0\\] As Eqn \\[ddot\\_r\\_2\\] is equal to zero, the expression contained in the brackets must be constant: \\[\\dot{r}^2 - \\dfrac{(8\\pi G \\rho_0 / 3)}{r} = k\\] Our final step is to replace \\(\\rho_0\\) with \\(\\rho\\), and divide by \\(r^2\\): \\[\\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{r}}{r}\\right)^2 - \\dfrac{8}{3}\\pi G \\rho = -\\dfrac{k}{r^2}\\] or \\[\\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{r}}{r}\\right)^2 + \\dfrac{k}{r^2} = \\dfrac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho\\] which is the same as the Friedman equation (Equation. \\[eqn:friedman\\]), when \\(c=1\\). 3.6 The meaning of \\(k\\) In the previous sections, \\(k\\) has been used to describe the curvature of the Universe. \\(k\\) has three possible values:2 \\(k = 0\\): no curvature. If \\(k=0\\), then \\(\\dot{a}\\) will always be positive. The expansion will continue but will be slowing down, as \\(\\rho\\) will be decreasing. This is known as a flat Universe, or a critical Universe. \\(k = 1\\): positive curvature. If \\(k = 1\\), then \\(\\dot{a}\\) will initially be positive, but will reach a point where it changes sign. The Universe will expand to a certain point then collapse back in on itself (aka the big crunch). This is known as a closed Universe. \\(k = -1\\): negative curvature. If \\(k=-1\\) then \\(\\dot{a}\\) will always be positive and the expansion will continue forever (aka the big rip). This is known as an open Universe. 3.7 Exercises Confirm for yourself how the behaviour of \\(k\\) affects the evolution of the scale factor (\\(a\\)) over time. For \\(k=1\\), at what point does the Universe fall back in on itself? Sketch how the scale factor evolves with time for the three values of \\(k\\). How does the inclusion of a cosmological constant, \\(\\Lambda\\), change the Friedman equation? "],
["ch-constituents.html", "Chapter 4 Composition of the Universe 4.1 Matter 4.2 Radiation 4.3 Mixing matter and radiation 4.4 Cosmological Constant 4.5 Exercises", " Chapter 4 Composition of the Universe Like all good physicists, Cosmologists like to simplify the Universe with assumptions. In the previous section we decided that the Universe is a perfect fluid. We’re continuing with that assumption here, now looking at how the different components of the Universe behave. In Section \\[sec:fluid\\_eqns\\] we stated that any possible components of the Universe could be described as perfect fluids. On a Cosmological scale, this is a reasonable assumption. However, not all Cosmological fluids behave in the same way. Each component will obey its own equation of state that describes how its pressure (\\(P\\)) and density (\\(\\rho\\)) are related. 4.1 Matter The simplest place to start is with the equation of state for matter, as that is the component that we are most familiar with. We know that for matter \\[P = 0\\] which we can substitute into the Fluid equation (Eqn \\[eqn:fluid\\]) to find \\[\\label{eqn:fluid_matter} \\dot{\\rho} + 3\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\rho = 0\\] Again, using our amazing differentiation skillz, we can show that Eqn \\[eqn:fluid\\_matter\\] can be rewritten as \\[\\dfrac{1}{a^3}\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\rho a^3\\right) = 0\\] This means that \\[\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\left(\\rho a^3\\right) = 0\\] or that \\[\\begin{aligned} {2} \\rho a^3 = \\text{constant,} &amp;\\qquad\\text{or}\\quad \\rho \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a^3}\\end{aligned}\\] This is not a surprising answer; it’s telling us that the density falls off with \\(a^3\\). We know that intuitively – if you keep the amount of material the same, but increase the volume, the density will fall off proportionally. We can rewrite this as \\[\\rho = \\dfrac{\\rho_0}{a^3}\\] where \\(\\rho_0\\) denotes the present day value. Now that we know how the density of the Universe evolves with the scale factor, we can look further into the fate of a “matter dominated” Universe. Aside: Power laws In case you hadn’t realised by now, a lot of Cosmology is built on assumptions and estimation. Luckily, these estimates describe evolution of the Universe very well. One such estimate is the power law – the astronomers favourite tool for estimating relations. Power laws, e.g \\(a \\propto t^q\\) crop up frequently in astronomy and cosmology, so it’s useful to be able to recognise when to use them. Substituting the above into the Friedman equation (and assuming \\(k=0\\)) gives \\[\\dot{a}^2 = \\dfrac{8\\pi G \\rho_0}{3}\\dfrac{1}{a}\\] We can substitute in the power law \\(a \\propto t^q\\) to find a relation between \\(a\\), \\(\\rho\\) and \\(t\\): \\[t^{(2q-2)} \\propto t^{-q}\\] which gives us \\(q = 2/3\\), or \\[\\begin{aligned} {1} a(t) &amp;= \\left(\\dfrac{t}{t_0}\\right)^{2/3}\\\\ \\rho(t) &amp;= \\dfrac{\\rho_0}{a^3} = \\dfrac{\\rho_0 t_{0}^{2}}{t^2}\\end{aligned}\\] The Hubble parameter, \\(H(t)\\), is a measure of the expansion rate of the Universe at time \\(t\\)3. \\(H(t)\\) is therefore related to \\(a\\), and hence \\(t\\): \\[H(t) \\equiv \\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a} = \\dfrac{2}{3t}\\] As discussed in Section \\[sec:curvature\\], we can see that in this \\(k=0\\), matter dominated Universe, the expansion will continue forever. It will slow down over time, becoming infinitely slow at \\(t=\\infty\\). 4.2 Radiation The equation of state for radiation is \\[P = \\dfrac{\\rho c^2}{3}\\] which we can substitute into the Fluid equation (Eqn. \\[eqn:fluid\\]): \\[\\begin{aligned} {1} \\dot{\\rho} + 3\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\left(\\rho + \\dfrac{\\rho c^2}{3}\\right) &amp;= 0\\\\ \\dot{\\rho} + 4\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\rho &amp;= 0\\end{aligned}\\] Using the same power law analysis as in Section 1.1, i.e. \\(a \\propto t^q\\), we find that \\(q = 1/2\\), leading to: \\[\\begin{array}{lcr} \\rho \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a^4} &amp; \\qquad a(t) = \\left(\\dfrac{t}{t_0}\\right)^{1/2} &amp; \\qquad \\rho(t) = \\dfrac{\\rho_0}{a^4} = \\dfrac{\\rho_0 t_0^2}{t^2}\\\\ \\end{array}\\] In the radiation dominated case, \\(\\rho(t)\\) decreases with \\(t^2\\), as is the case with the matter dominated case. However, when we consider the scale factor, \\(a\\), we find: \\[H(t) \\equiv \\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a} = \\dfrac{1}{2t}\\] meaning that the Universe expands more slowly when it is radiation dominated than when it is matter dominated. This may seem counterintuitive at first; for a matter dominated Universe the energy density is proportional to the volume of the Universe (\\(1/a^3\\)), so why is this not the same for a radiation dominated Universe? The answer lies in what happens to radiation under an increase in the scale factor. 4.2.1 Why does a radiation dominated Universe expand more slowly? As the Universe expands, the scale factor \\(a\\) increases. The energy density of the radiation will decrease proportionally as the volume increases. However, the radiation loses additional energy, proportional to \\(a\\), as the photons are redshifted. A photon travelling between two galaxies. \\[fig:redshift\\_galaxies\\] Consider a photon travelling between two points in space, as shown in Figure \\[fig:redshift\\_galaxies\\]. The relative velocities of the galaxies in Fig. \\[fig:redshift\\_galaxies\\] is given by \\[\\label{eqn:red_1} dv = H dr = \\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a} dr\\] We can use the Doppler law to find the change of the photon’s wavelength, \\(d\\lambda\\), while it’s travelling between the two positions \\[\\label{eqn:red_2} \\dfrac{d\\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\dfrac{dv}{c}\\] The travel time of the photon is \\(dt = dr/c\\), which we can combine with Equations \\[eqn:red\\_1\\] and \\[eqn:red\\_2\\] to find \\[\\label{eqn:lambda_a} \\dfrac{d\\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a} \\dfrac{dr}{c} = \\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a} dt\\] Integrating Equation \\[eqn:lambda\\_a\\] shows that \\(\\ln \\lambda = \\ln a + \\text{constant}\\), i.e. \\[\\lambda \\propto a\\] The energy of a photon is proportional to its wavelength, so \\[E = \\dfrac{h c}{\\lambda} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a}\\] This reduction in energy by an additional factor of \\(a\\) accounts for the slowed expansion in a radiation dominated Universe. 4.3 Mixing matter and radiation In Sections 1.1 and 1.2 we considered the cases where the Universe was composed of either only matter or only radiation. This is not particularly realistic; the Universe contains a mixture of these two components. We found that the energy densities of matter and radiation are related to the scale factor by different amounts, with the radiation energy density decreasing more quickly as \\(a\\) increases: \\[\\begin{array}{lr} \\rho_{\\text{mat}} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a^3} &amp;\\qquad \\rho_{\\text{rad}} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a^4} \\end{array}\\] Even though the Universe is a mixture of matter and radiation, it still obeys the Friedman equation (Eqn. \\[eqn:friedman\\]) in the same way, with the individual densities combined into a single value of \\(\\rho\\): \\[\\rho = \\rho_{\\text{mat}} + \\rho_{\\text{rad}}\\] We could solve the Friedman equation in full, but in practice only the density term that dominates significantly affects the evolution of the scale factor at any given time. At early times, the radiation energy density will dominate over the matter energy density, meaning that \\(a\\) will evolve as in the radiation case: \\[a(t) \\propto t^{1/2}\\] Combining this with our individual equations for \\(\\rho(t)\\) we find \\[\\begin{array}{lr} \\rho_{\\text{rad}} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{t^2} &amp; \\qquad \\rho_{\\text{mat}} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a^3} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{t^{3/2}} \\end{array}\\] Evolution of the matter (orange solid line) and radiation (blue dashed line) density components as a function of time in a mixed composition Universe. Radiation dominates for early times, but as \\(t\\) (hence \\(a\\)) increase, matter becomes the dominant component. \\[fig:density\\_fig\\] Initially, radiation will dominate. However, as \\(t\\) increases, the energy density contribution from matter will dominate over radiation, as shown in Figure \\[fig:density\\_fig\\]. However, when the matter density dominates, \\(a\\) will evolve as in the matter case: \\[\\begin{array}{lcr} a(t) \\propto t^{2/3} &amp; \\qquad \\rho_{\\text{mat}} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{t^2} &amp; \\qquad \\rho_{\\text{rad}} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{a^4} \\propto \\dfrac{1}{t^{8/3}} \\end{array}\\] 4.4 Cosmological Constant The final case that we haven’t considered is the contribution from the cosmological constant, \\(\\Lambda\\) and its density \\(\\rho_{\\Lambda}\\). We know from observations that the Universe is now in the \\(\\Lambda\\) (Dark Energy) dominated era, but what does that mean for its evolution? The fluid equation for \\(\\Lambda\\) is \\[\\dot{\\rho_{\\Lambda}} + 3\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a} \\left(\\rho_{\\Lambda} + \\dfrac{P_{\\Lambda}}{c^2}\\right) = 0\\] We know that \\(\\rho_{\\Lambda}\\) is constant over time, which leads to \\[P_\\Lambda = -\\rho_{\\Lambda}c^2\\] This means that \\(\\Lambda\\) has a negative effective pressure. As Universe expands, work is done on the \\(\\Lambda\\) fluid, allowing its density to stay constant even as the Universe increases in volume. We’ll come back to the ridiculousness of \\(\\Lambda\\) later in the course. 4.5 Exercises So far we’ve looked at the cases for matter, where \\(P = 0\\), and radiation, where \\(P = \\rho c^2 / 3\\). Consider a generic equation of state where \\(P = (\\gamma - 1) \\rho c^2\\), where \\(0 &lt; \\gamma &lt; 2\\). Find equations for \\(\\rho(a)\\), \\(a(t)\\) and \\(\\rho(t)\\) for this equation of state. Assume a flat Universe, i.e. \\(k=0\\). Recall the Friedman equation: \\[\\left(\\dfrac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)^2 = \\dfrac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho - \\dfrac{k}{a^2}\\] Considering the equations you derived in part 1, what value of \\(\\gamma\\) is required so that \\(\\rho\\) has the same time dependence as the curvature term, \\(k/a^2\\)? Assuming \\(k&lt;0\\), find the solution \\(a(t)\\) to the Friedman equation for a fluid with the value of \\(\\gamma\\) you derived in part 2. "]
