Observational Parameters {#ch:obs-params}
===================================

Cosmological Models {#sec:cosmomodels}
--------------------------

Our understanding of how the Universe evolves can be contained in a **Cosmological model**. Such models are specified by a number of parameters, such as the densities of radiation and matter, the Universe's curvature, and the Hubble parameter, to name a few. 

These parameters are measured observationally to determine which cosmological model best describes the Universe, with different experiments being able to constrain different parameters.

The most widely accepted cosmological model is known as **$\Lambda$CDM**, which describes a Universe with two key features:
1. The energy density of dark matter is dominated by **cold dark matter** (i.e. non-relativistic particles)
2. The total energy density contains a significant contribution from the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, which we ascribe to **dark energy**.

We will now look at the main observational parameters in today's cosmological models.

The Hubble Constant $H_{0}$ {#sec:ho-cosmo}
--------------------------

The Hubble constant ($H_{0}$) is a measurement of the **current** expansion rate of the Universe. In cosmological models it is often expressed as the dimensionless parameter $h$, where

\begin{equation}
H_0 = 100 h \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}
(\#eq:h-h0)
\end{equation}

$H_{0}$ is measured by comparing distances of objects to their redshifts, such that
\begin{equation}
H_0 = \dfrac{v}{r}
(\#eq:h0-v-r)
\end{equation}
where $v$ and $r$ are the recession velocities (redshifts) and distances of a sample of objects, such as supernova host galaxies. The first measurement of $H_0$ was made by Hubble in 1929 (see Sec. \@ref(sec:expanding_intro)). Since then, many measurements of $H_0$ have been made using large samples of galaxies out to higher and higher redshifts. We will cover the details of these experiments in the Observational Techniques section.

We can also use measurements of $H_0$ to estimate the age of the Universe. As we showed in Chapter \@ref(ch:constituents), 
\begin{equation}
H(t) = \dfrac{\dot{a}}{a}
(\#eq:ht-a)
\end{equation}
By substituting $\dot{a}$ and $a$ for their values now to get $H_0$ (i.e. $H_{t_0}$), we find that the age of the Universe, assuming that matter dominates the energy density, is
\begin{equation}
H(t) = \dfrac{2}{3t}
(\#eq:ht-a-2)
\end{equation}
This is a rough estimate, as at early times the Universe was not matter dominated (and it may not be now either!), but it gives a reasonable guess.
